Preface to Third Edition

This edition covers the new syllabus of the examining boards and
written in SI units to conform to their use in all future Advanced
level examinations.
The main change in the text has been in the sections in Electricity
on magnetic and electric fields and their associated phenomena. In
the treatment, (i) magnetic flux density or induction B and electric
and
this follows the
intensity E have been used in preference to
recommendations of the 1966 report of the Association for Science
Education, (ii) magnetic flux density has been defined from the relation
F = BIl. A new section on electromagnetic waves has been added.
Other changes are as follows: Waves. This has now been treated
generally. Optics. The sections on interference and diffraction have
been expanded. Sound. An account of recording on tape and film has
been added. Heat The joule has been used as the unit of heat and van
der Waals' equation has been discussed. Properties of Matter The
repulsive and attractive forces between molecules have been emphasised. Mechanics. There are further discussions on angular momentum and the dynamics of a rigid body. Throughout the text, worked
examples in SI units have been given to assist the student and the
exercises at the end of chapters contain recent questions from examining
boards. It is hoped that this SI edition will continue to assist students
of Advanced level standard.
We are very much indebted to M. V. Detheridge, Woodhouse
Grammar School, London, for his valuable co-operation in the writing
and the preparation of the new electricity sections and for his generous
assistance with this edition. We are also grateful to Rev. M. D. Phillips,

Preface to First Edition

This text-book is designed for Advanced Level students of Physics,
and covers Mechanics and Properties of Matter, Heat, Optics, and
Sound. Electricity and Atomic Physics to that standard. It is based on
the experience gained over many years of teaching and lecturing to a
wide variety of students in schools and polytechnics.
In the treatment, an Ordinary Level knowledge of the subject is
assumed. We have aimed at presenting the physical aspect of topics
as much as possible, and then at providing the mathematical arguments
and formulae necessary for a thorough understanding. Historical
details have also been given to provide a balanced perspective of the
subject. As a help to the student, numerous worked examples from past
examination papers have been included in the text.
It is possible here to mention only a few points borne in mind by the
authors. In Mechanics and Properties of Matter, the theory of dimensions has been utilized where the mathematics is difficult, as in the subject of viscosity, and the "excess pressure" formula has been extensively
used in the treatment of surface tension. In Heat, the kinetic theory of
gases has been fully discussed, and the experiments of Joule and

detail. The constant value of n sin / has
been emphasized in refraction at plane surfaces in Optics, there is a full
treatment of opticaltreatment of optical instruments, and accounts of
interference, diffraction and polarization. In Sound, the physical
principles of stationary waves, and their applications to pipes and
strings, have been given prominence. Finally, in Electricity the electron
and ion have been used extensively to produce explanations of phenomena in electrostatics, electromagnetism, electrolysis and atomic
physics the concept of e.m.f. has been linked at the outset with energy
and there are accounts of measurements and instruments.

Dynamics

Motion

in a Straight Line. Velocity

If a car travels steadily in a constant direction and covers a distance s
in a time t, then its velocity in that direction = s/t. If the car does not
travel steadily, then s/t is its average velocity, and
distance s

=

average velocity x

t.

We are here concerned with motion in a constant direction. The term
is given to the distance moved in a constant direction,
example, from L to C in Fig. 1.1 (i). Velocity may therefore be
defined as the rate of change of displacement.
Velocity can be expressed in centimetres per second (cm/s orcms" *)
_1
or metres per second (m/s or
s
) or kilometres per hour (km/h or
-1
kmh ). By calculations, 36 kmh -1 = 10 ms" 1 It should be noted
that complete information is provided for a velocity by stating its
direction in addition to its magnitude, as explained shortly.
If an object moving in a straight line travels equal distances in equal
times, no matter how small these distances may be, the object is said
to be moving with uniform velocity. The velocity of a falling stone
increases continuously, and so is a non-uniform velocity.
If, at any point of a journey, As is the small change in displacement in
a small time At, the velocity v is given by v = As/At. In the limit, using

Vectors

Displacement and velocity are examples of a class of quantities called
which have both magnitude and direction. They may therefore
be represented to scale by a line drawn in a particular direction. Thus

and direction by a straight line LC 4 cm long 20° E. of N., where
1 cm represents 20 km, Fig. 1.1 (i). Similarly, we can represent the
velocity u of a ball initially thrown at an angle of 30° to the horizontal
by a straight line OD drawn to scale in the direction of the velocity u,
the arrow on the line showing the direction, Fig. 1.1 (ii). The acceleration
due to gravity, g, is always represented by a straight line AO to scale
drawn vertically downwards, since this is the direction of the acceleration, Fig. 1.1 (iii). We shall see later that 'force' and 'momentum' are
other examples of vectors.

direction but only magnitude, like 'mass' or 'density' or 'temperature'.

These quantities are called scalars.
The distinction between speed and velocity can be made clear by
reference to a car moving round a circular track at 80 km h~ * say. Fig.

it is 80 km h
1.2. At every point on the track the speed is the same

Fig.

Velocity and speed

At every point, however, the velocity is different. At A, B or C, for
example, the velocity is in the direction of the particular tangent, AP,
BQ or CR, so that even though the magnitudes are the same, the three
velocities are all different because they point in different directions.
Generally, vector quantities can be represented by a line drawn in the
direction of the vector and whose length represents its magnitude.
Distance-Time Curve

When

the displacement, or distance, s of a moving car from some
is plotted against the time t, a distance-time (s — t) curve of

fixed point

DYNAMICS
is obtained The velocity of the car at any instant is given
by the change in distance per second at that instant. At E, for example,
if the change in distance s is As and this change is made in a time At,

the motion

velocity at

As
E=
At

In the limit, then, when At approaches zero, the velocity at E becomes
equal to the gradient of the tangent to the curve at EL Using calculus
notation, As/At then becomes equal to ds/dt (p. 1).

(.s)-time (/) curves

If the distance-time curve is a straight line CD, the gradient is
constant at all points; it therefore follows that the car is moving with
a uniform velocity, Fig. 1.3. If the distance-time curve is a curve CAB,
the gradient varies at different points. The car then moves with nonuniform velocity. We may deduce that the velocity is zero at the instant
corresponding to A, since the gradient at A to the curve CAB is zero.
When a ball is thrown upwards, the height s reached at any instant
2
t is given by s = ut—\gt , where u is the initial velocity and g is the
constant equal to the acceleration due to gravity (p. 8). The graph
of s against t is represented by the parabolic curve CXY in Fig. 1.3 ; the
gradient at X is zero, illustrating that the velocity of the ball at its
maximum height is zero.

Velocity-Time Curves

When

the velocity of a moving train is plotted against the time, a
(v-t) curve' is obtained. Useful information can be deduced from this curve, as we shall see shortly. If the velocity is uniform,
the velocity-time graph is a straight line parallel to the time-axis, as

Acceleration is the 'rate of change of velocity', i.e. the change of
velocity per second. The acceleration of the train at any instant is given
by the gradient to the velocity-time graph at that instant, as at E. At the
peak point A of the curve OAB the gradient is zero, i.e., the acceleration
is then zero. At any point, such as G, between A, B the gradient to the

adding the two velocities. Since velocity is a vector quantity, we draw
a line OA to represent 30 km h~ * in magnitude and direction, and then,
from the end of A, draw a line AC to represent 6 km h~ x in magnitude
and direction, Fig. 1.8 (ii). The sum, or resultant, of the velocities is now
represented by the line OC in magnitude and direction, because a
distance moved in one second by the ship (represented by OA) together
with a distance moved in one second by the boy (represented by AC)
is equivalent to a movement of the boy from

LAWS OF MOTION. FORCE AND MOMENTUM

The following examples illustrate the application of F = ma. It
should be carefully noted that (i) F represents the resultant force on the
object of mass m, (ii) F must be expressed in the appropriate units of a

Suppose, however, that the person flexes his knees and is brought to

the force F now acting is 10 times less than before, or 50 kgf (approx).
Consequently, much less damage is done to the person on landing.

Motion of centre of mass
If two particles, masses m t and m 2 are distances x t ,x 2 respectively
from a given axis, their centre of mass is at a distance x from the axis
given by m t x t +m 2 x 2 = {m-^+m^x. See p. 104. Since velocity, v =dx/dt
generally, the velocity v of the centre of mass in the particular direction
is given by m 1 v l +m 2 v 2 = {m 1 + m 2 )v, where
are the respective
l5 v 2
velocities of m 1 ,m 2 The quantity (m 1 v t + m 2 v 2 ) represents the total
momentum of the two particles. The quantity (m x +m 2 )v = Mv, where
is the total mass of the particles. Thus we can imagine that the total
mass of the particles is concentrated at the centre of mass while they
move, and that the velocity v of the centre of mass is always given by

act on the particles while moving, then, since action
and reaction are equal and opposite, their resultant on the whole body
is zero. Consequently the total momentum is unchanged and hence
the velocity or motion of their centre of mass if unaffected. If an external
force, however, acts on the particles, the total momentum is changed.
The motion of their centre of mass now follows a path which is due to
If internal forces

the external force.

We can apply this to the case of a shell fired from a gun. The centre
of mass of the shell follows at first a parabolic path. This is due to the
external force of gravity, its weight. If the shell explodes in mid-air,
the fragments fly off in different directions. But the numerous internal
forces which occur in the explosion have zero resultant, since action
and reaction are equal and opposite and the forces can all be paired.
Consequently the centre of mass of all the fragments continues to follow
the same parabolic path. As soon as one fragment reaches the ground,
an external force now acts on the system of particles. A different
parabolic path is then followed by the centre of mass
If a bullet is fired in a horizontal direction from a rifle, where is
their centre of mass while the bullet and rifle are both moving?

Work
When an

engine pulls a train with a constant force of 50 units
through a distance of 20 units in its own direction, the engine is said
by definition to do an amount of work equal to 50 x 20 or 1000 units,
is the amount of
the product of the force and the distance. Thus if
work,
= force x distance moved in direction of force.

W

Work is a scalar quantity; it has no property of direction but only
magnitude. When the force is one newton and the distance moved is
moving
one metre, then the work done is one joule. Thus a force of 50
does 50 x 10 or 500 joule of work. Note
through a distance of 10
this is also a measure of the energy transferred to the object.
The force to raise steadily a mass of 1 kg is 1 kilogram force (1 kgf ),
(see p. 14). Thus if the mass of 1 kg is raised

Before leaving the topic of 'work', the reader should note carefully
we have assumed the force to move an object in its own direction.
Suppose, however, that a force P pulls an object a distance s along a
acting at an angle to it, Fig. 1.19. The component of P along

is P cos

direction OA. The component of P along a direction perpendicular to

In general, the work done by a force is equal to the product of the force
and the displacement of its point of application in the direction of the
force.

Power

When an engine does work quickly, it is said to be operating at a
high power; if it does work slowly it is said to be operating at a low
power. 'Power' is defined as the work done per second, i.e.,

object is said to possess energy if it can do work. When an object
possesses energy because it is moving, the energy is said to be kinetic,

it can raise another object attached to it by a rope passing
over a pulley, for example. A coiled spring also has energy, which is

When a body falls in the earth's gravitational field, a small part of
the energy is used up in overcoming the resistance of the air. This
energy is dissipated or lost as heat
it is not regained in moving the
body back to its original position. This resistance is another example
of the action of a non-conservative force.
Although energy may be transformed from one form to another,
as in the last example from mechanical energy to heat, the total energy
in a given system is always constant. If an electric motor is supplied
with 1000 joule of energy, 850 joule of mechanical energy, 140 joule
of heat energy and 10 joule of sound energy may be produced. This
is called the Principle of the Conservation of Energy and is one of the

given system of objects is constant even though collisions or other
actions took place between them)
(2) The Principle of the Conservation of Energy (the total energy of a
given system is constant). From Einstein's relation, however, the two
laws can be combined into one, namely, the Principle of the Conservation of Energy.

Application of Dimensions. Simple Pendulum
If a small mass is suspended from a long thread so as to form a simple
pendulum, we may reasonably suppose that the period, T, of the oscillations depends only on the mass m, the length / of the thread, and the
acceleration, g, due to gravity at the place concerned. Suppose then that

CIRCULAR MOTION
Acceleration in a circle

When a stone is attached to a string and whirled round at constant
speed in a circle, one can feel the force in the string needed to keep the
stone moving. The presence of the force, called a centripetal force,
implies that the stone has an acceleration. And since the force acts
towards the centre of the circle, the direction of the acceleration,
which is a vector quantity, is also towards the centre.
To obtain an expression for the acceleration towards the centre,
consider an object moving with a constant speed v round a circle of
radius r. Fig. 2.2 (i). At A, its velocity vA is in the direction of the tangent
AC; a short time St later at B, its velocity vB is in the direction of the
tangent BD. Since their directions are different, the velocity uB is
different from the velocity vA, although their magnitudes are both
equal to v. Thus a velocity change or acceleration has occurred from

A to B.

Centripetal forces

The force F required to keep an object of mass m moving in a circle
of radius r = ma = mv 2 /r. It is called a centripetal force and acts
towards the centre of the circle. When a stone A is whirled in a horizontal circle of centre
by means of a string, the tension T provides
the centripetal force. Fig. 2.3 (i). For a racing car moving round a
circular track, the friction at the wheels provides the centripetal force.
Planets such as P, moving in a circular orbit round the sun S, have a
centripetal force due to gravitational attraction between S and P

attached to the end of a string,

the bucket can be whirled in a vertical plane without any water falling
out. When the bucket is vertically above the point of support O, the
2
weight mg of the water is less than the required force mv /r towards
the centre and so the water stays in. Fig. 2.3 (iii). The reaction R of the
bucket base on the water provides the rest of the force. If the bucket is
2
whirled slowly and mg > mv /r, part of the weight provides the force

mv 2 /r. The

rest of the

weight causes the water to accelerate

downward

and hence to leave the bucket.
Centrifuges
Centrifuges are used to separate particles in suspension from the
dense liquid in which they are contained. This mixture is poured
into a tube in the centrifuge, which is then whirled at high speed in a
less

horizontal circle.
The pressure gradient due to the surrounding liquid at a particular
2
distance, r say, from the centre provides a centripetal force of mrco
for a small volume of liquid of mass m, where co is the angular velocity.

and here they collect. Thus when the centrifuge is stopped,
and the container or tube assumes a vertical position, the suspension
is found at the top of the tube and clear liquid at the bottom. For the
same reason, cream is separated from the denser milk by spinning the
mixture in a vessel. The cream spirals towards the centre and collects
spiral paths,

here.

Motion of Bicycle Rider Round Circular Track

When

a person on a bicycle rides round a circular racing track, the
frictional force F at the ground provides
the inward force towards the centre or
centripetal force. Fig. 2.4. This produces
a

Variation of g with latitude

The acceleration due to gravity, g, varies over the earth's surface.
This is due to two main causes. Firstly, the earth is elliptical, with the
6
metre and the equatorial radius, a,
polar radius, b, 6-357 x 10
6
6-378 x 10 metre, and hence g is greater at the poles than at the equator,
where the body is further away from the centre of the earth. Secondly,
the earth rotates about the polar axis, AB. Fig. 2.7. We shall consider
this effect in more detail, and suppose the earth is a perfect sphere.
In general, an object of mass m suspended by a spring-balance at a

point on the earth would be acted on by an upward force T = mg',
where g' is the observed or apparent acceleration due to gravity. There
would also be a downward attractive force mg towards the centre of
the earth, where g is the acceleration in the absence of rotation.

SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION
Circular

motion

When the bob of a pendulum moves
to-and-fro through a small angle, the bob
is said to be moving with simple harmonic
motion. The prongs of a sounding tuning
and the layers of air near it, are moving
with simple harmonic motion, and light
waves can be considered due to simple

variations.

Simple harmonic motion is closely associated with circular motion. An example
is shown in Fig. 2.9. This illustrates an
arrangement used to convert the circular
into the to-and-fro or
motion of a disc
simple harmonic motion of a piston P.
The disc is driven about its axle O by a
peg
fixed near its rim. The vertical

Q

motion drives P up and down. Any horizontal component of the
motion merely causes Q to move along the slot S. Thus the simple
harmonic motion of P is the projection on the vertical line YY' of the
circular motion of Q.
An everyday example of an opposite conversion of motion occurs in
car engines. Here the to-and-fro or 'reciprocating' motion of the
piston engine is changed to a regular circular motion by connecting
rods and shafts so that the wheels are turned.
Formulae in Simple Harmonic Motion
Consider an object moving round a circle of radius r and centre Z with
a uniform angular velocity co, Fig. 2.10. If CZF is a fixed diameter, the
foot of the perpendicular from the moving object to this diameter moves
from Z to C, back to Z and across to F, and then returns to Z, while the
object moves once round the circle from O in an anti-clockwise direction. The to-and-fro motion along CZF of the foot of the perpendicular
is defined as simple harmonic motion.
Suppose the object moving round the circle is at A at some instant,
where angle OZA = 0, and suppose the foot of the perpendicular
from A to CZ is M. The acceleration of the object at A is co 2 r, and this

(1)

The minus

indicates, of course, that the object begins to retard as it
passes the centre, Z, of its motion. If the minus were omitted from
equation (1) the latter would imply that the acceleration increases as
y increases, and the object would then never return to its original

position.

We can now form a definition of simple harmonic motion. It is the
motion of a particle whose acceleration is always (i) directed towards a
fixed point, (ii) directly proportional to its distance from that point.

The graph of y v. t is shown in Fig. 2.10, where ON represents the
and OS the t-axis; since the angular velocity of the object moving
round the circle is constant, 6 is proportional to the time t. Thus as the
foot of the perpendicular along CZF moves from Z to C and back to Z,
the graph OLP is traced out; as the foot moves from Z to F and returns
to Z, the graph PHQ is traced out. The graph is a sine curve. The
complete set of values of v from O to Q is known as a cycle. The
number of cycles per second is called the frequency. The unit '1 cycle
per second' is called '1 hertz (Hz)\ The mains frequency in Great

We shall now study some cases of simple harmonic motion. Consider a simple pendulum, which
consists of a small mass m attached to the end
of a length / of wire, Fig. 2.14. If the other end of
the wire is attached to a fixed point P and the
mass is displaced slightly, it oscillates to-and-fro
along the arc of a circle of centre P. We shall
now show that the motion of the mass about its
is simple harmonic motion.

At a given place on the earth, where g is constant, the formula shows
T depends only on the length, /, of the pendulum.
Moreover, the period remains constant even when the amplitude of the
vibrations diminish owing to the resistance of the air. This result was
first obtained by Galileo, who noticed a swinging lantern one day, and
timed the oscillations by his pulse. He found that the period remained

it rises to the top of the swing. The reverse occurs as it swings back.
In the case of oscillating layers of air when a sound wave passes,
kinetic energy of the moving air molecules is converted to potential
energy when the air is compressed. In the case of electrical oscillations,
a coil L and a capacitor C in the circuit constantly exchange energy;

Wave equation

Waves and their properties can be demonstrated by producing them
on the surface of water, as in a ripple tank. As the wave travels outwards
from the centre of disturbance, it reaches more distant particles of
water at a later time. Thus the particles of water vibrate out of phase
with each other while the wave travels. It should be noted that the
vibrating particles are the origin of the wave. Their mean position
remains the same as the wave travels, but like the simple harmonic
oscillators previously discussed, they store and release energy which is

handed on from one part of the medium to another. The wave shows
the energy travelling through the medium.
If the displacement y of a vibrating particle P is represented by

= a sin cot, the displacement of a neighbouring particle
can be
represented by y = a sin (cot + cf>). cf> is called the phase angle between
the two vibrations. If <j> = n/2 or 90°, the vibration of
is y = a sin
(cot+n/2). In this case, y =

it can be seen that

from some chosen origin such as the centre of disturbance. Now the
wavelength, X, of a wave is the distance between successive crests or
troughs. At these points the phase difference is 2n. Consequently the
phase angle for a distance x is (x/X) x In or 2tzx/X. The wave equation,
which takes x into account as well as the time t, can thus be written as

Other forms of the wave equation may be used. The velocity v of
a wave is the distance travelled by the disturbance in 1 second. If the
frequency of the oscillations is f, then / waves travel outwards in 1
second. Each wave occupies a length X. Hence v = fX. Further, the
period Tis the time for 1 oscillation. Thus/= 1/Tand hence v =fX =

A

transverse wave is one produced by vibrations perpendicular to
the direction of travel of the wave. Light waves are transverse waves.
The wave along a bowed string of a violin is a transverse wave.

Velocity of waves

There are various types of waves. A longitudinal wave such as a
sound wave is a mechanical wave. The speed v with which the energy
travels depends on the restoring stress after particles in the medium are
strained from their original position. Thus v depends on the modulus
of elasticity of the medium It also depends on the inertia of the particles,
of which the mass per unit volume or density p is a measure.
By dimensions, as well as rigorously, it can be shown that
v

=

/modulus of elasticity

is Young's modulus, E. Thus v = yJE/p.
modulus is the bulk modulus, k. Hence
v = yjk/p. In air, k = yp, where y is the ratio of the principal specific
heats of air and p is the atmospheric pressure. Thus v = yjyp/p (p. 163).
When a taut string is plucked or b owed, the velocity of the transverse
wave along it is given by v = y/T/m, where T is the tension and m is the

mass per unit length of the string. In this case T provides the restoring
force acting on the displaced particles of string and m is a measure of
their inertia.

Electromagnetic waves, which are due to electric and magnetic
vibrations, form an important group of waves in nature. Radio waves,
infra-red, visible and ultra-violet light, X-rays, and y-rays are all
electromagnetic waves, ranging from long wavelength such as 1000

the waves. The speed of all electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is the

frequency travelling in the opposite direction is represented by the
same form of equation but with — x in place of x, that is, by y =
a sin 2n(t/T+ x/X).
The principle of superposition states that the combined effect or
resultant of two waves in a medium can be obtained by adding the
displacements at each point due to the respective waves. Thus if the
displacement due to one wave is represented by y t and that due to the
other wave by y 2 , the resultant displacement y is given by

Unlike the progressive wave, where the energy travels outwards
through the medium, Fig. 2.19 (ii), the energy of the stationary wave
remains stored in one part of the medium. Stationary waves are
produced in musical instruments when they are played. Stationary
radio waves are also produced in receiving aerials. Stationary waves,
due to electron motion, are believed to be present around the nucleus
of atoms.

Interference. Diffraction

A stationary wave is a special case of interference between two waves.
Another example occurs when two tuning forks of nearly equal frequency are sounded together. A periodic variation of loud sounds
called 'beats' is then heard. They are due to the periodic variation of
the amplitude of the resultant wave. If two very close coherent sources
of light are obtained, interference between the two waves may produce
bright and dark bands.
Diffraction is the name given to the interference between waves
coming from coherent sources on the same undivided wavefront. The
effect is pronounced when a wave is incident on a narrow opening
whose width is of comparable order to the wavelength. The wave now
spreads out or is 'diffracted' after passing through the slit. If the width
of the slit, however, is large compared with the wavelength, the wave
passes straight through the opening without any noticeable diffraction.
This is why visible light, which has wavelengths of the order of 6 x
10~ 7 m, passes straight through wide openings and produces sharp
shadows; whereas sound, which has wavelengths over a million times
longer and of the order of say 0-5 m, can be heard round corners.
Further details of wave phenomena are discussed in the Sound and
Optics sections of the book.

Rotation of Rigid Bodies

So

far in this book we have considered the equations of motion and
other dynamical formulae associated with a particle. In practice,
however, an object is made of millions of particles, each at different
places, and we need now to consider the motion of moving objects.

Angular momentum is analogous to 'linear momentum', mv, in the
dynamics of a moving particle. In place of m we have J, the moment of

Further, the conservation of angular momentum, which corresponds

Consider a cylinder C rolling along a plane without slipping, Fig. 3.13.
At any instant the line of contact, PQ, with the plane is at rest, and we
can consider the whole of the cylinder to be rotating about this axis.
Hence the energy of the cylinder = \l x (o 2 where I t is the moment of
inertia about PQ and co is the angular velocity.

is hollow, instead of solid as assumed, the moment of
about an axis through the centre of gravity parallel to the plane
is greater than that for a solid cylinder, assuming the same mass and
dimensions (p. 88). The time taken for a hollow cylinder to roll a
given distance from rest on the plane is then greater than that taken by
the solid cylinder, from reasoning similar to that above; and thus if
no other means were available, a time test on an inclined plane will
distinguish between a solid and a hollow cylinder of the same dimensions and mass. If a torsion wire is available, however, the cylinders
can be suspended in turn, and the period of torsional oscillations
determined. The cylinder of larger moment of inertia, the hollow
cylinder, will have a greater period, as explained on p. 89.

same period is obtained between two non-symmetrical points on a

bob at one end and a wooden bob of the same size at the other. A movable large

apart. The period is then slightly greater than 2 seconds.
To find g, the pendulum is set up in front of an accurate seconds clock, with the
bob of the clock and that of the Kater pendulum in line with each other, and

Equilibrium of Three Coplanar Forces

any object is in equilibrium under the action of three forces, the
two of the forces must be equal and opposite to the third
force. Thus the line of action of the third force must pass through the
point of intersection of the lines of action of the other two forces.
As an example of calculating unknown forces in this case, suppose

Couples and Torque

There are many examples

in practice where two forces, acting
or turning-effect on some object. As a very
pimple case, suppose two strings are tied to a wheel at X, Y, and two
'e^ual and opposite forces, F, are exerted tangentially to the wheel,
Fig. 4.7 (i). If the wheel is pivoted at its centre, O, it begins to rotate
about
in an anticlockwise direction.
Two equal and opposite forces whose lines of action do not coincide
are said to constitute a couple in Mechanics. The two forces always
have a turning-effect, or moment, called a torque, which is defined by

case of a ruler, the centre of gravity is the point of support when the
ruler is balanced. A similar method can be used to find roughly the
centre of gravity of a flat plate. A more accurate method consists of
suspending the object in turn from two points on it, so that it hangs
freely in each case, and finding the point of intersection of a plumb-line,

suspended in turn from each point of suspension. This experiment is
described in elementary books.
An object can be considered to consist of many small particles. The
forces on the particles due to the attraction of the earth are all parallel
since they act vertically, and hence their resultant is the sum of all the
forces. The resultant is the weight of the whole object, of course. In
the case of a rod of uniform cross-sectional area, the weight of a particle

i.e., by symmetry, it follows that the resultant of the weights of all the
particles of the rod acts at O. Hence the centre of gravity of a uniform
rod is at its mid-point.
The centre of gravity, C.G., of the curved surface of a hollow cylinder
acts at the midpoint of the cylinder axis. This is also the position of the
C.G. of a uniform solid cylinder. The C.G. of a triangular plate or
lamina is two-thirds of the distance along a median from corresponding
point of the triangle. The C.G. of a uniform right solid cone is threequarters along the axis from the apex.
Similarly, the resultant of the weight of a particle B,

If the marble A is disturbed and displaced to B, its energy increases.
When it is released, the marble rolls back to A. Thus the marble at A
is said to be in stable equilibrium. Note that the centre of gravity of A
is raised on displacement to B. On this account the forces in the field
return the marble from B to A, where its potential energy is lower.
Suppose now that the bowl S is inverted and the marble is placed at its
top point at A. Fig. 4.11 (ii). If A is displaced slightly to C, its potential
energy and centre of gravity are then lowered. A now continues to
move further away from B under the action of the forces in the field.

Pressure

Liquids and gases are called fluids. Unlike solid objects, fluids can

If a piece of cork is pushed below the surface of a pool of water and
then released, the cone rises to the surface again. The liquid thus
exerts an upward force on the cork and this is due to the pressure
exerted on the cork by the surrounding liquid. Gases also exert pressures. For example, when a thin closed metal can is evacuated, it

Atmospheric Pressure

observed the height of a water column in a tube placed in a deep well.

About 1640 Torricelli thought of the idea of using mercury instead
of water, to obtain a much shorter column. He completely filled a

was the first occasion
in the history of science that a vacuum had been created.
If the tube in Fig. 4.20 is inclined to the vertical, the mercury ascends
the tube to a level B at the same vertical height H above the level of the
mercury in D as A.
The pressure on the surface of the mercury in D is atmospheric
pressure; and since the pressure is transmitted through the liquid, the
atmospheric pressure supports the column of mercury in the tube.
Suppose A is at a height H above the level of the mercury in D. Now
the pressure, p, at the bottom of a column of liquid of height H and
density p is given by p = Hpg (p. 1 10). Thus if H = 760 mm = 0-76 m

Barometer

barometer

is

an instrument for measuring the

pressure of the atmosphere, which is required in
weather-forecasting, for example. The most accurate
form of barometer is due to Fortin, and like the
simple arrangement already described, it consists
basically of a barometer tube containing mercury,

with a vacuum at the top, Fig. 4.21. One end of
the tube dips into a pool of mercury contained in a
washleather bag B. A brass scale C graduated in
centimetres and millimetres is fixed at the top of the
barometer. The zero of the scale correspondings to
the tip of an ivory tooth P, and hence, before the
level of the top of the mercury is read from the scales,
the screw S is adjusted until the level of the mercury
in B just reaches the tip of P. A vernier scale V
can be moved by a screw
until the bottom of it
just reaches the top of the mercury in the tube, and
the reading of the height of the mercury is taken
from C and V. Torricelli was the first person to
observe the variation of the barometric height as
the weather changed.

Archimedes' Principle. Thus if an iron cube of volume 400 cm 3 is

totally immersed in water of density 1 g cm
the upthrust on the
cube = 400 x 1 = 400 gf. If the same cube is totally immersed in oil of

density 0-8 g cm
the upthrust on it = 400 x 0-8 = 320 gf.

Fig. 4.22

Archimedes' Principle

Fig. 4.22 shows why Archimedes' Principle is true. If S is a solid
immersed in a liquid, the pressure on the lower surface C is greater
than on the upper surface B, since the pressure at the greater depth h 2
is more than that at h v The pressure on the remaining surfaces D and
E act as shown. The force on each of the four surfaces is calculated by
summing the values of pressure x area over every part, remembering
that vector addition is needed to sum forces. With a simple rectangularshaped solid and the sides, D, E vertical, it can be seen that (i) the
resultant horizontal force is zero, (ii) the upward force on C =
pressure x area A = h 2 pgA, where p is the liquid density and the
downward force on B = pressure x area A = h^pgA. Thus

Flotation

When an object floats in a liquid, the upthrust on the object must be
equal to its weight for equilibrium. Cork has a density of about 0-25 g
em" 3 so that 100 cm 3 of cork has a mass of 25 g. In water, then, cork
sinks until the upthrust is 25 gf. Now from Archimedes' Principle,
25 gf is the weight of water displaced. Thus the cork sinks until 25 cm 3

Along the part BCD of the curve, the potential energy V is negative.
Along the part AB, the potential energy Vis positive. The force between
the molecules is always given by F = —dV/dr = —potential gradient.
Along CD the force is attractive and it decreases with distance r
according to an inverse-power of r. Along ABC, the force is repulsive.
Fig. 5.1 shows the variation of F with r.
At C, the minimum potential energy point of the curve, the molecules
would be at their normal distance apart in the absence of thermal
energy. The equilibrium distance OM, r
is of the order 2 or 3 x

they would repel each other. If they are further apart, (r > r \ they

Phases or States of Matter

The molecules in a solid are said to be in a 'condensed' phase or state.
Their thermal energy is then relatively low compared with their
potential energy V and the molecules are 'bound' to each other.
They may now vibrate about C, the minimum of the curve in Fig. 5.1.
When the thermal energy increases by an amount corresponding to

This corresponds to a mean separation of molecules which is greater

places with other molecules, whereas in a solid the neighbours of a
particular molecule remain unchanged. Further, the molecules of a
liquid have translational as well as vibrational energy, that is, they
move about constantly through the liquid, whereas molecules of a
solid have vibrational energy only.
As the temperature of the liquid rises, the thermal energy of the
molecules further increases. The average distance between the molecules
then also increases and so their mean potential energy approaches
zero, as can be seen from Fig. 5.1. At some stage the increased thermal

energy enables the molecules to completely break the bonds of attraction which keep them in a liquid state. The molecules then have little
or no interaction and now form a gas. At normal pressures the forces
of attraction between the gas molecules are comparatively very small
and the molecules move about freely inside the volume they occupy.
Gas molecules which are monatomic such as helium have translational
energy only. Gas molecules such as oxygen or carbon dioxide, with
two or more atoms, have rotational and vibrational energies in addition
to translational energy.

Gases

At normal pressure, permanent gases such as

shows that Boyle's law is obeyed by this ideal gas. Consequently, the

between the gas molecules at normal pressure are
unimportant. They increase appreciably when the gas is at high pressure as the molecules are then on the average very much closer.
In the bulk of the gas, the resultant force of attraction between a
particular molecule and those all round it is zero when averaged over a
period. Molecules which strike the wall of the containing vessel,
however, are retarded by an unbalanced force due to molecules behind
them. The observed pressure p of a gas is thus less than the pressure in
the ideal case, when the attractive forces due to molecules is zero.
Van der Waals derived an expression for this pressure 'defect'. He
considered that it was proportional to the product of the number of
molecules per second striking unit area of the wall and the number per
unit volume behind them, since this is a measure of the force of attraction. For a given volume of gas, both these numbers are proportional
to the density of the gas. Consequently the pressure defect, p x say, is
proportional to p x p or p 2 For a fixed mass of gas, p oc 1/V, where V

gas. Taking into account the attractive forces between the molecules,
it follows that, if p is the observed pressure, the gas pressure in the bulk
of the gas = p+a/V 2
The attraction of the walls on the molecules arriving there is to
increase their velocity from v say to v + Av. Immediately after rebounding from the walls, however, the force of attraction decreases the velocity
to v again. Thus the attraction of the walls has no net effect on the
momentum change due to collision. Likewise, the increase in momentum of the walls due to their attraction by the molecules arriving is lost
after the molecules rebound.
The effect of the volume actually occupied by all the molecules is
represented by a constant b, so that the volume of the space in which
they move is not V but (V—b). The magnitude of b is not the actual
volume of the molecules, as if they were swept into one corner of the
space, since they are in constant motion, b has been estimated to be
about four times the actual volume.

Energy of Liquid Surface. Molecular theory

The feet that a liquid surface is in a state of tension can be explained
by the intermolecular forces discussed on p. 125. In the bulk of the
liquid, which begins only a few molecular diameters downwards from
the surface, a particular molecule such as A is surrounded by an equal
number of molecules on all sides. This can be seen by drawing a sphere
round A. Fig. 5.3. The average distance apart of the molecules is such
that the attractive forces balance the repulsive forces (p. 145), Thus the
average intermolecular force between A and the surrounding molecules
is

zero. Fig. 5.3.

Consider now a molecule such as C or B in the surface of the liquid.
There are very few molecules on the vapour side aboveC or B compared

Liquid drops

This is why raindrops, and small droplets of mercury, are approximately spherical in shape. Fig. 5.4 (i). To eliminate completely the
effect of gravitational forces, Plateau placed a drop of oil in a mixture
of alcohol and water of the same density. In this case the weight of the
drop is counterbalanced by the upthrust of the surrounding liquid.
He then observed that the drop was a perfect sphere. Plateau's 'spherule'
experiment can be carried out by warming water in a beaker and then
carefully introducing aniline with the aid of a pipette. Fig. 5.4 (ii).
At room temperature the density of aniline is slightly greater than water.
At a higher temperature the densities of the two liquids are roughly the
same and the aniline is then seen to form spheres, which rise and fall in
the liquid.

A

soap bubble is spherical because its weight is extremely small and
the liquid shape is then mainly due to surface tension forces. Although
the density of mercury is high, small drops of mercury are spherical.
The ratio of surface area (4nr 2 ) to weight (or volume, 4nr 3 /3) of a

surface tension forces.

Surface tension definition. Units, dimensions
Since the surface of a liquid acts like an elastic skin, the surface is
a state of tension. A blown-up football bladder has a surface in a
state of tension. This is a very rough analogy because the surface
tension of a bladder increases as the surface area increases, whereas
the surface tension of a liquid is independent of surface area. Any
line in the bladder surface is then acted on by two equal and opposite
forces, and if the bladder is cut with a knife the rubber is drawn away
from the incision by the two forces present.
R. C. Brown and others have pointed out that molecules in the surface of a liquid have probably a less dense packing than those in the
bulk of the liquid, as there are fewer molecules in the surface when its
area is a minimum. The average separation between molecules in the
surface are then slightly greater than those inside. On average, then,
the force between neighbouring molecules in the surface are attractive
in

This would explain the existence of surface tension.

Angle of Contact
In the case of water in a glass capillary tube, observation of the
meniscus shows that it is hemispherical if the glass is clean, that is, the
glass surface is tangential to the meniscus where the water touches it.
In other cases where liquids rise in a capillary tube, the tangent BN to
the liquid surface where it touches the glass may make an acute angle
with the glass, Fig. 5.8 (i). The angle is known as the angle of contact
between the liquid and the glass, and is always measured through the
liquid. The angle of contact between two given surfaces varies largely
with their freshness and cleanliness. The angle of contact between
water and very clean glass is zero, but when the glass is not clean the
angle of contact may be about 8° for example. The angle of contact
between alcohol and very clean glass is zero.

that a liquid will rise in a capillary tube if the angle of contact is acute,

and that a liquid will be depressed in the tube if the angle of contact is
obtuse. For the same reason, clean water spreads over, or 'wets', a
clean glass surface when spilt on it, Fig. 5.9 (i); the angle of contact is
zero. On the other hand, mercury gathers itself into small pools or
globules when spilt on glass, and does not 'wet' glass, Fig. 5.9 (ii). The

The difference in behaviour of water and mercury on clean glass can
be explained in terms of the attraction between the molecules of these
substances. It appears that the force of cohesion between two molecules
of water is less than the force of adhesion between a molecule of water
and a molecule of glass; and thus water spreads over glass. On the
other hand, the force of cohesion between two molecules of mercury
is greater than the force of adhesion between a molecule of mercury
and a molecule of glass; and thus mercury gathers in pools when

Surface Tension of a Soap Solution

The surface tension of a soap solution can be found by a similar
method. A soap-film is formed in a three-sided metal frame ABCD, and
the apparent weight is found, Fig. 5.14. When the film is broken by
piercing it, the decrease in the apparent weight, mg, is equal to the

be noted that the surface tension forces on the sides AB,
of the frame act horizontally, and their resultant is zero.
A soap film can be supported in a vertical rectangular frame but a
film of water can not. This is due to the fact that the soap drains downward in a vertical film, so that the top of the film has a lower concentration of soap than the bottom. The surface tension at the top is thus
greater than at the bottom (soap diminishes the surface tension of
pure water). The upward pull on the film by the top bar is hence
greater than the downward pull on the film by the lower bar. The net
upward pull supports the weight of the film. In the case of pure water,
however, the surface tension would be the same at the top and bottom,
and hence there is no net force in this case to support a water film in a
rectangular frame.

Two soap-bubbles of unequal size can be blown on the ends of a tube,
communication between them being prevented by a closed tap in the
middle. If the tap is opened, the smaller bubble is observed to collapse
gradually and the size of the larger bubble increases. This can be
explained from our formula p = 4y/r, which shows that the pressure
of air inside the smaller bubble is greater than that inside the larger
bubble. Consequently air flows from the smaller to the larger bubble
when communication is made between the bubbles, and the smaller
bubble thus gradually collapses.
Since the excess pressure in a bubble is inversely-proportional to the
radius, the pressure needed to form a very small bubble is high. This
explains why one needs to blow hard to start a balloon growing. Once
the balloon has grown, less air pressure is needed to make it expand
more.

SURFACE TENSION

Rise or Fall of Liquids in Capillary Tubes
From our knowledge of the angle of contact and the excess pressure
on one side of a curved liquid surface, we can deduce that some liquids
will rise in a capillary tube, whereas others will be depressed.
Suppose the tube A is placed in water, for example, Fig. 5.18 (i). At
first the liquid surface becomes concave upwards in the tube, because
the angle of contact with the glass is zero. Consequently the pressure
on the air side, X, of the curved surface is greater than the pressure on
the liquid side Y by 2y/r, where y is the surface tension and. r is the
radius of curvature of the tube. But the pressure at X is atmospheric,
H. Hence the pressure at Y must be less than atmospheric by 2y/r.
Fig. 5.18 (i) is therefore impossible because it shows the pressure at Y
equal to the atmospheric pressure. Thus, as shown in Fig. 5.18 (ii), the

Effects of surface tension in measurements

When a hydrometer is used to measure relative density or density,
the surface tension produces a downward force F on the hydrometer.
If r is the radius of the stem and the angle of contact is~ zero, then
F = 2nry. For a narrow stem, the error produced in reading the
from the graduations is small.
Another case of an undesirable surface tension effect occurs in
measurements of the height of liquid columns in glass tubes. The height
of mercury in a barometer, for example, is depressed by surface tension (p. 114). If the tubes are wide, surface tension forces can be neglected. If they are narrow, the forces must be taken into account. As
an illustration, consider an inverted U-tube dipping into two liquids

Method

By forming a bubble inside a liquid, and measuring the excess
was able to determine the variation of the surface
tension of a liquid with temperature. One form of the apparatus is
shown in Fig. 5.24 (i). A capillary or drawn-out tubing A is connected
pressure, Jaeger

to a vessel

W containing a funnel C, so that

air is

driven slowly through

A when water enters W through C, so that air is driven slowly through
A when water enters W through C. The capillary A is placed inside a

beaker containing the liquid L, and a bubble forms slowly at the end of
it at a slow rate.
Fig. 5.24. (ii) shows the bubble at three possible stages of growth.
The radius grows from that at a to a hemispherical shape at b. Here

A when air is passed through

its

pressure

is

larger since the radius

is

smaller. If

we

consider the

bubble growing to c, the radius of c would be greater than that of b
and hence it cannot contain the increasing pressure. The downward
force on the bubble due to the pressure, in fact, would be greater than

unstable and breaks away from A when its radius is the same as that of A.
Thus as the bubble grows the pressure in it increases to a maximum,
and then decreases as the bubble breaks away. The maximum pressure

By adding warm liquid to the vessel containing L, the variation of
the surface tension with temperature can be determined. Experiment
shows that the surface tension of

liquids,

and water

decreases with increasing temperature along a fairly

in particular,

smooth

curve.

Various formulae relating the surface tension to temperature have been
proposed, but none has been found to be completely satisfactory. The
decrease of surface tension with temperature may be attributed to the
greater average separation of the molecules at higher temperature.
The force of attraction between molecules is then reduced, and hence
the surface energy is reduced, as can be seen from the potential energy
curve on p. 126.

Surface Tension and Surface Energy

We now

consider the surface energy of a liquid and its relation to
surface tension y. Consider a film of liquid stretched across a horizontal frame ABCD, Fig. 5.25. Since y is the force per unit length, the

Suppose the rod is now moved a

the surface tension forces, so that the
surface area of the film increases. The

tension alters (p. 145). If the surface
area increases under isothermal (constant temperature) conditions, however, the surface tension is constant;

also called the free surface energy.

Surface energy and Latent heat
Inside a liquid molecules move about in all directions, continually
breaking and reforming bonds with neighbours. If a molecule in the
surface passes into the vapour outside, a definite amount of energy is
needed to permanently break the bonds with molecules in the liquid.
This amount of energy is the work done in overcoming the inward
force on a molecule in the surface, discussed on p. 129. Thus the energy
needed to evaporate a liquid is related to its surface energy or surface
tension. The latent heat of vaporisation, which is the energy needed to

change liquid to vapour

at the boiling point,

is

therefore related to

surface energy.
Surface energy
seen, when the surface area of a liquid is increased, the surface
increased The molecules which then reach the surface are slowed
up by the inward force, so the average translational kinetic energy of all the liquid
molecules is reduced. On this account the liquid cools while the surface is increased, and heat flows in from the surroundings to restore the temperature.
The increase in the total surface energy per unit area E is thus given by

original length when the load was removed. For loads greater than
about 5 kgf, however, the extension increases relatively more and
more, and the wire now no longer returns to its original length when
it is unloaded. The wire is thus permanently strained, and A corresponds

to

its elastic limit.

Hooke's Law

From the straight line graph OA, we deduce that the extension is
proportional to the load or tension in the wire when the elastic limit is not
exceeded. This is known as Hooke's law, after Robert Hooke, founder
of the Royal Society, who discovered the relation in 1676. The law
shows that when a molecule of a solid is displaced farther from its
mean position, the restoring force is proportional to its displacement
(see p. 126). One may therefore conclude that the molecules of a solid
are undergoing simple harmonic motion (p. 44).
The measurements also show that it would be dangerous to load the
wire with weights greater than 5 kilogrammes, the elastic limit, because
the wire then suffers a permanent strain. Similar experiments in the
research laboratory enable scientists to find the maximum load which
a steel bridge, for example, should carry for safety. Rubber samples
are also subjected to similar experiments, to find the maximum safe
tension in rubber belts used in machinery.

Yield Point. Ductile and Brittle Substances. Breaking Stress

Careful experiments show that, for mild steel and iron for example,
the molecules of the wire begin to 'slide' across each other soon after
the load exceeds the elastic limit, that is, the material becomes plastic.

increased further the extension increases rapidly along the

Determination of Young's Modulus

The magnitude of Young's modulus for a material in the form of a

from the top B to the vernier V by a ruler, since an error of 1 millimetre
is negligible compared with an original length of several metres. For
very accurate work, the extension can be measured by using a spirit
level between the two wires, and adjusting a vernier screw to restore the
.spirit level to its original reading after a load is added.

At Royal Ordnance and other Ministry of Supply factories, tensile
testing is carried out by placing a sample of the material in a machine
known as an extensometer, which applies stresses of increasing value
along the length of the sample and automatically measures the slight
increase in length. When the elastic limit is reached, the pointer on the
dial of the machine flickers, and soon after the yield point is reached the
sample becomes thin at some point and then breaks. A graph showing

a Wire

Suppose that a wire has an original length I and is stretched by a
length e when a force F is applied at one end. If the elastic limit is not
exceeded, the extension is directly proportional to the applied load
(p. 154). Consequently the force in the wire has increased in magnitude
from zero to F, and hence the average force in the wire while stretching
was F/2. Now

In sensitive current-measuring instruments, a very weak control is
needed for the rotation of the instrument coil. This may be provided
by using a long elastic or torsion wire of phosphor bronze in place of a
spring. The coil is suspended from the lower end of the wire and when
it rotates through an angle 0, the wire sets up a weak opposing couple
equal to cO, where c is the elastic constant of the wire. Quartz fibres
are very fine but comparatively strong, and have elastic properties.
They are also used for sensitive control (see p. 61).

Solid Friction. Viscosity

SOLID FRICTION
Static Friction

When

a person walks along a road, he or she is prevented from
by the force of friction at the ground. In the absence of friction,
for example on an icy surface, the person's shoe would slip when placed
on the ground. The frictional force always opposes the motion of the
slipping

shoe.

The

frictional force

between the surface of a table and a block of

wood A can be

A

investigated by attaching one end of a string to
and
the other to a scale-pan S, Fig. 7.1. The string passes over a fixed

Fig. 7.1

Solid friction

grooved wheel B. When small weights are added to S, the block does
not move. The frictional force between the block and table is thus
equal to the total weight on S together with the weight of S. When
more weights are added, A does not move, showing that the frictional
force has increased, but as the weight is increased further, A suddenly
begins to slip. The frictional force now present between the surfaces is
called the limiting frictional force, and we are said to have reached
limiting friction. The limiting frictional force is the maximum frictional

force between the surfaces.
Coefficient of Static Friction

The normal reaction, R, of the table on A is equal to the weight of A.
By placing various weights on A to alter the magnitude of R, we can
find

Kinetic Friction. Coefficient of Kinetic (Dynamic) Friction

When brakes are applied to a bicycle, a frictional force is exerted
between the moving wheels and brake blocks. In contrast to the case
of static friction, when one of the objects is just on the point of slipping,
the frictional force between the moving wheel and brake blocks is
called a kinetic (or dynamic) frictional force. Kinetic friction thus
occurs between two surfaces which have relative motion.
The coefficient of kinetic (dynamic) friction, p!, between two surfaces
is defined by the relation

independent of the relative velocity of the surfaces.

Theory of Solid Friction

The laws of solid friction were known hundreds of years ago, but
they have been explained only in comparatively recent years, mainly
by

Bowden and

collaborators. Sensitive methods, based on
measurements, reveal that the true area of
contact between two surfaces is extremely small, perhaps one tenthousandth of the area actually placed together for steel surfaces. This
is explained by photographs which show that some of the atoms of a
metal project slightly above the surface, making a number of crests or
'humps'. As Bowden has stated 'The finest mirror, which is flat to a
millionth of a centimetre, would to anyone of atomic size look rather
like the South Downs
valley and rolling hills a hundred or more
atoms high.' Two metal surfaces thus rest on each others projections

the other.
Since the area of actual contact is extremely small, the pressures at
2
the points of contact are very high, perhaps 1000 million kgf per
for steel surfaces. The projections merge a little under the high pressure,
producing adhesion or 'welding' at the points, and a force which
opposes motion is therefore obtained. This explains Law 1 of the laws
of solid friction. When one of the objects is turned over, so that a
smaller or larger surface is presented to the other object, measurements
show that the small area of actual contact remains constant. Thus the
frictional force is independent of the area of the surfaces, which explains
Law 2. When the load increases the tiny projections are further squeezed

m

174

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

by the enormous pressures until the new area of contact becomes big
enough to support the load. The greater the load, the greater is the
area of actual contact, and the frictional force is thus approximately
proportional to the load, which explains Law 3.

VISCOSITY
If we move through a pool of water we experience a resistance to our
motion. This shows that there is a frictional force in liquids. We say
this is due to the viscosity of the liquid. If the frictional force is com-

paratively low, as in water, the viscosity of the liquid is low if the
frictional force is large, as in glue or glycerine, the viscosity of the
liquid is high.

small steel ball-bearings to fall through each liquid. The sphere falls
more slowly through the liquid of higher yiscosity.
As we shall see later, the viscosity of a lubricating oil is one of the
factors which decide whether it is suitable for use in an engine. The

Newton's Formula. Coefficient of Viscosity

When water flows slowly and steadily through a pipe, the layer of
the liquid in contact with the pipe is practically stationary, but the
central part
of the water is moving relatively fast, Fig. 7.3. At other
layers between
and C, such as B, the water has a velocity less than at
C, the magnitude of the velocities being represented by the length of the

Now

as in the case of

two

solid surfaces

Pipe^
Fig. 7.3

Laminar (uniform) flow through pipe

moving over each other, a frictional force is exerted between two liquid
layers when they move over each other. Thus because the velocities of
neighbouring layers are different, as shown in Fig. 7.3, a frictional
force occurs between the various layers of a liquid
through a pipe.

when flowing

The basic formula for the frictional force, F, in a liquid was first
suggested by Newton. He saw that the larger the area of the surface
of liquid considered, the greater was the frictional force F. He also
stated that

F was

directly proportional to the velocity gradient at the

p^rt of the liquid considered. This

This expression for the frictional force in a liquid should be contrasted
with the case of solid friction, in which the frictional force is independent
of the area of contact and of the relative velocity between the solid
surfaces concerned (p. 173).

Steady Flow of Liquid Through Pipe. Poiseuille's Formula

The steady flow of liquid through a pipe was first investigated
thoroughly by Poiseuille in 1844, who derived an expression for the
volume of liquid issuing per second from the pipe. The proof of the
formula is given on p. 208, but we can derive most of the formula by
the method of dimensions (p. 31).
The volume of liquid issuing per second from the pipe depends on

Molecular theory of viscosity
Viscous forces are detected in. gases as well as in liquids. Thus if a
is spun round in a gas close to a suspended stationary disc, the
latter rotates in the same direction. The gas hence transmits frictional
forces. The flow of gas through pipes, particularly in long pipes as in
transmission of natural gas from the North Sea area, is affected by the
viscosity of the gas.
The viscosity of gases is explained by the transfer of momentum which

Introduction

Temperature

We are interested in heat because it is the commonest form of energy,
and because changes of temperature have great effects on our personal
comfort, and on the properties of substances, such as water, which we
use every day. Temperature is a scientific quantity which corresponds
to primary sensations— hotness and coldness. These sensations are
not reliable enough for scientific work, because they depend on

summer's day, but warm on a winter's day, although a thermometer
may show that it has a lower temperature in the winter* A thermometer,

such as the familiar mercury-in-glass instrument (Fig. 8.1), is a device
whose readings depend on hotness or coldness, and which we choose
to consider more reliable than our senses. We are justified in considering
it more reliable because different thermometers of the same type agree
with one another better than different people do.
The temperature of a body, then, is its degree of hotness, as measured
on a thermometer. The thermometer was invented in Italy about 1630:
it consisted of an open-ended tube, with a bulb full of water at its lower
end. The water rose in the tube when the bulb was warmed, and fell

As a

liquid for use in thermometers, water soon gave way to linseed
or alcohol, and by about 1 660 thermometer-makers had begun to seal
the top of the tube. Early thermometers had no definite scale, like that of
a modern thermometer; some of them were used for showing the temperatures of greenhouses, and were mounted on wooden backboards,
which were carved with grapes and peaches for example, to indicate the
correct temperatures for growing the different fruits. The thermometer
as we know it to-day, containing pure mercury and graduated according
to a universal scale, was developed by Fahrenheit in 1724.

a mercury thermometer is to be graduated, it is placed first
and then in steam from boiling water (Fig. 8.2). The
temperature of the steam depends on the atmospheric pressure, as we

pressure of 76 cm mercury is chosen. In both steam and ice, when the
level of the mercury has become steady, it is marked on the glass the

called the lower fixed point, or ice-point,

steam is called the upper fixed point,
between the fixed points is called the fundamental interval of the thermometer. For scientific work, the fundamental interval is divided into
100 equal parts (Fig. 8.1). This division was first proposed by Celsius
in 1742, and the graduations are called degrees Centigrade or, in
modern nomenclature, degrees Celsius (°C); the ice-point is 0°C and the
steam-point 100°C.

Thermodynamic Scale

The thermodynamic scale of temperature is adopted as the SI
temperature scale. On this scale, the kelvin is the unit of temperature.
It is defined as 1/27316 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple
point of water (p. 319).
The symbol for temperature is 'K' without a degree sign. Thus the
triple point of water, TtT is 273- 16

The temperature change or interval of one degree Celsius, 1 degC

Types of Thermometer

The mercury-in-glass thermometer depends on the change in volume
of the mercury with hotness; it is cheap and simple, but is not reliable
enough for accurate work (Chapter 14). Other types of thermometer
depend on the change, with hotness, of the pressure of a gas at constant
volume or the electrical resistance of a metal (Fig. 8.3). Another type of

thermometer depends on the electromotive force change with temperature of two metals joined together. Fig. 8.4 (a) shows two wires,
one of copper and one of iron, soldered together at A. The ends of the
wires are joined to a galvanometer G. When the junction A is heated,
a current flows which deflects the galvanometer. The current usually
increases with the temperature difference between the hot and cold
ends of the wires. For temperature measurement two junctions are
used, as in Fig. 8.4 (b); the second one, called the cold junction, is
maintained at 0°C by ice-water.
Each of these quantities e.m.f., resistance, pressure gives its own
temperature scale, and the different scales agree only at the fixed points,
where their readings are defined as 0°C and 100°C. (When we speak of

interval is R l00

HEAT AND ENERGY
Heat and Temperature
If we run hot water into a lukewarm bath, we make it hotter; if we
run cold water in, we make it cooler. The hot water, we say, gives heat
to the cooler bathrwater; but the cold water takes heat from the
warmer bath-water. The quantity of heat which we can get from hot
water depends on both the mass of water and on its temperature: a
bucket-full at 80°C will warm the bath more than a cup-full at 100°C.
Roughly speaking, temperature is analogous to electrical potential,
and heat is analogous to quantity of electricity. We can perceive temperature changes, and whenever the temperature of a body rises, that
body has gained heat. The converse is not always true when a body is
melting or boiling, it is absorbing heat from the flame beneath it, but
its temperature is not rising.
;

Latent Heat and Specific Heat

The heat which a body absorbs, in melting or boiling, it gives out
again in freezing or condensing; such heat is called latent, or hidden,
heat, because it does not show itself by a change in temperature. When
a body absorbs heat without changing its state, its temperature rises,
and the heat absorbed was first called 'sensible heat'.
The term 'latent heat' was used by Black (1728-99); he and a Swede,
Wilcke, discovered latent heats independently at about the same dateBlack by hanging a bucket of ice in a warm room, Wilcke by pouring
boiling water on to snow.
Also independently, Black and Wilcke studied what we now call
specific heats; the name is due to Wilcke. In his experiments Wilcke
dropped various hot bodies into cold water, and measured the temperature rises which they caused. In this way he showeq* that a given
mass of glass, for example, gave out only one-fifth as much heat as an
equal mass of water, in cooling through the same temperature range.
He therefore said that the specific heat of glass was 0-2.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the nature of heat was
disputed; some thought of heat as the motion of the particles of a
body, others thought of it as a fluid, filling the body's pores. Measurements of heat were all relative, and no unit of the quantity of heat was
defined. In the nineteenth century, however, the increasing technical
importance of heat made a unit of it essential. The units of heat chosen
were

the calorie (cal): this is the amount of heat required to warm
1 gramme (g) of water through 1 deg C (see also p. 194);
the British Thermal Unit (Btu) this is the amount of heat required
to warm 1 lb of water through 1 deg F.

Heat and Energy
Steam-engines became common in the early part of the eighteenth
century but they were not thought of as heat-engines until the latter
part of that century. Consequently the early engines were wasteful of
fuel, squandering useful heat in warming and cooling the cylinder at
every stroke of the piston. Watt reduced this waste of heat by his
invention of the separate condenser in 1769. Trevithick, about 1800,
devised an engine which was driven by steam which entered the cylinder
at a pressure above atmospheric, and therefore at a temperature above
100°C (p. 304). In this engine, the steam came out of the exhaust at a
temperature no higher than in earlier engines, so that a greater fraction
of the heat which it carried from the boiler was used in the engine.
The idea of heat as a form of energy was developed particularly by
Benjamin Thompson (1753-1814); he was an American who, after
adventures in Europe, became a Count of the Holy Roman Empire,
;

and war minister of Bavaria. He is now generally known as Count
Rumford. While supervising his arsenal, he noticed the great amount
of heat which was liberated in the boring of cannon. The idea common
at the time was that this heat was a fluid, pressed out of the chips of
metal as they were bored out of the barrel. To measure the heat produced, Rumford used a blunt borer, and surrounded it and the end of
the cannon with a wooden box, filled with water (Fig. 8.6). From the
weight of water, and the rate at which its temperature rose, he concluded
that the boring operation liberated heat at the same rate as 'nine wax
candles, burning with a clear flame'. He showed that the amount of heat
liberated was in no way connected with the mass of metal bored away,
and concluded that it depended only on the work done against friction.
It followed that heat was a form of energy.

Rumford published the results of his experiments in 1798. No similar
experiments were made until 1840, when Joule began his study of
heat and other forms of energy. Joule measured the work done, and the
heat produced, when water was churned, in an apparatus which we shall
on p. 197. He also measured the work done and heat produced
was churned, when air was compressed, when water was
forced through fine tubes, and when cast iron bevel wheels were rotated
one against the other. Always, within the limits of experimental error,
he found that the heat liberated was proportional to the mechanical
work done, and that the ratio of the two was the same in all types of
experiment. His last experiments, made in 1878, showed that about
772 ft-lbf of work were equivalent to one British thermal unit of heat.
This ratio Joule called the mechanical equivalent of heat. The metric
unit of work or energy is the joule, J. Since experiment shows that heat
is a form of energy, the joule is now the scientific unit of heat. 'Heat per

by multiplying them by 4-2. See p. 199.
In other experiments, Joule measured the heat liberated by an electric

current in flowing through a resistance; at the same time he measured
the work done in driving the dynamo which generated the current.
He obtained about the same ratio for work done to heat liberated as
in his direct experiments. This work linked the ideas of heat, mechanical,
and electrical energy. He also showed that the heat produced by a

related to the chemical energy used up.

The Conservation of Energy
As a result of all his experiments, Joule developed the idea that
energy in any one form could be converted into any other. There might
be a loss of useful energy in the process
for example, some of the heat
from the furnace of a steam-engine is lost up the chimney, and some
more down the exhaust but no energy is destroyed. The work done
by the engine added to the heat lost as described and the heat developed
as friction, it is equal to the heat provided by the fuel burnt. The
idea underlying this statement is called the Principle of the Conservation of Energy. It implies that, if we start with a given amount of energy
in any one form, we can convert it in turn into all other forms; we may
not always be able to convert it completely, but if we keep an accurate
balance-sheet we shall find that the total amount of energy, expressed
in any one form
say heat or work— is always the same, and is equal

—

—

—

to the original

amount.

—

The conservation of energy applies to living organisms plants and
animals
as well as to inanimate systems. For example, we may put a
man or a mouse into a box or a room, give him a treadmill to work,
and feed him. His food is his fuel; if we burn a sample of it, we can
measure its chemical energy, in heat units. And if we now add up the

is the cource of man's energy,
commonly expressed in kilocalories, which is the heat
required to warm 1 kilogramme of water through 1 deg C. A man
needs about 3000 kilocalories per day.
Muscles are unique in their capacity to turn chemical energy directly
into mechanical energy. When a muscle is stimulated, complex phosphates in its tissues break down; in doing so, they cause the muscle
fibres to swell and shorten. Thus, via the bones and joints, the muscle
does external work. When the muscle is recovering after contraction,
the phosphates are built up again by a series of reactions, involving the
oxidation of sugars. The sugars and oxygen are brought to the muscle
in the arterial blood; the waste products of the reactions, water and
carbon dioxide, are carried away in the venous blood. 1 Recently
physiologists have found evidence that muscles may also convert
mechanical energy into chemical. 2 For example, when we walk downstairs, gravity does work on our leg-muscles some of this appears as
heat, but some, it now seems, is used in reversing the chemical actions
of muscle activity.
All the energy by which we live comes from the sun. The sun's
ultra-violet rays are absorbed in the green matter of plants, and make
them grow the animals eat the plants, and we eat them we are all
vegetarians at one remove. The plants and trees of an earlier age decayed, were buried, and turned into coal. Even water-power comes

from the sun we would have no lakes if the sun did not evaporate the
sea and provide the rainfall which fills the lakes. The relationship
between all the principal forms of energy are summarized in Fig. 8.7.
Joule's Historic Experiments

About 1 847 Joule measured the mechanical equivalent of heat by an apparatus
of the form shown in Fig. 8.8. C is a copper cylinder, about 30 cm in diameter,
containing water. The water is churned by paddles P, and prevented from
whirling round en masse by baffles B. The paddles are connected by a coupling

shows the temperature of the water.
Joule would start an experiment by allowing the weights
to fall to the
ground and turn the paddles. He would then break the coupling K, and re-wind
the weights without disturbing the paddles. In this way he would make the
weights fall twenty times or more, in a single experiment, and so increase the
work done on the water and consequently the temperature rise.
Suppose n is the number of falls then the work
done on the water = 2nMgh,
where

height of the fall. The heat Q gained by the cylinder and the water is (mc + C)0,

where m is the mass of water, c w the heat capacity of the cylinder and paddles,

An experiment of this kind takes a long time about half an hour because
a great deal of work, by everyday standards, must be done to produce a measurable
amount of heat. The cooling correction is therefore relatively great.
Many people refused to accept Joule's work at first, because of the very small
temperature differences on which it rested. Nevertheless, Joule's final result
differs only by about one part in 400 from the value given by the best modern

198

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

experiments. In calculating his final result, Joule made corrections for the kinetic
energy of the weights as they struck the floor, the work done against friction in the
pulleys and the bearings of the paddle wheel, and the energy stored by the
stretching of the strings; he even estimated the energy in the hum which the
strings emitted, but found it was negligible.
Joule's Large-scale Experiments

In his last experiments, about 1878, Joule rotated the paddles with an engine,
thereby eliminating many

of the corrections just

the cylinder on a wire,

hang it on a thread in a steam jacket, J, fitted with a thermometer.
The jacket is plugged with cotton wool to prevent loss of heat by
convection. While the solid is warming, we weigh a thin- walled copper
vessel A called a calorimeter (mc g), then run about 50 cm 3 of water
into it, and by subtraction find the mass m r of this water. We put the
calorimeter into a draught-shield S, and take the temperature, X of
the water in it. After we have given the specimen time to warm up
say half an hour
we read its temperature, 3 then we slide the calorimeter under the jacket, and drop the specimen into it. After stirring
the mixture, we measure its final temperature, 2 If no heat leaves the

Hence calorimeters are often surrounded with a shield S, as in Fig. 9.1,
and the heat loss due to conduction is made small by packing S with
insulating material or by supporting the calorimeter on an insulating
ring, or on threads. The loss by radiation is small at small excess
temperatures over the surroundings. In some simple calorimetric experiments the

final

temperature of the mixture

is

reached quickly, so

The total loss of heat is therefore
negligible in laboratory experiments on the specific heats of metals,
but not on the specific heat capacities of bad conductors, such as rubber,
which give up their heat slowly. When great accuracy is required, the
loss of heat by leakage is always taken into account.

Law of Cooling

Newton was

the first person to investigate the heat lost by a body in
that the rate of loss of heat is proportional to the excess
temperature over the surroundings. This result, called Newton's law of
cooling, is approximately true in still air only for a temperature excess
of about 20°C or 30°C; but it is true for all excess temperatures in
air.

conditions of forced convection of the air, i.e. in a draught. With
natural convection Dulong and Petit found that the rate of loss of
heat was proportional to 5 '4 , where

this appears to be true for higher excess temperatures, such as from
50°C to 300°C. At low excess temperatures, however, less than 1°C,

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

G. T. P. Tarrant has pointed out that radiation, not convection, is
the major contributing factor to the rate of cooling of an object.
To demonstrate Newton's law of cooling, we plot a temperature (retime (t) cooling curve for hot water in a calorimeter placed in a draught
(Fig. 9.2 (a)). If R is the room temperature, then the excess temperature
of the water is (6-0R ). At various temperatures, such as in Fig. 9.2 (b),
we drew tangents such as APC to the curve. The slope of the tangent,
in degrees per second, gives us the rate of fall of temperature, when the
water

then plot these rates against the excess temperature, — 9R as in
(c), and find a straight line passing through the origin. Since
the heat lost per second by the water and calorimeterls proportional
to the rate of fall of the temperature, Newton's law is thus verified.

Fig. 9.2

Heat Loss and Temperature Fall
Besides the excess temperature, the rate of heat loss depends on the
exposed area of the calorimeter, and on the nature of its surface a dull
surface loses heat a little faster than a shiny one, because it is a better
radiator (p. 343). This can be shown by doing a cooling experiment
twice, with equal masses of water, but once with the calorimeter
polished, and once after it has been blackened in a candle-flame. In

proportional to its volume. The rate of heat
loss, however, is proportional to the surface area of the body. The
rate of fall of temperature is therefore proportional to the ratio of
surface to volume of the body. For bodies of similar shape, the ratio
of surface to volume is inversely proportional to any linear dimension.
If the bodies have surfaces of similar nature, therefore, the rate of fall
of temperature is inversely proportional to the linear dimension: a
small body cools faster than a large one. This is a fact of daily experience
a small coal which falls out of the fire can be picked up sooner than a
large one; a tiny baby should be more thoroughly wrapped up than a
grown man. In calorimetry by the method of mixtures, the fact that a
small body cools faster than a large one means that, the larger the
specimen, the less serious is the heat loss in transferring it from its
heating place to the calorimeter. It also means that the larger the scale
of the whole apparatus, the less serious are the errors due to loss of
heat from the calorimeter.

Heat Capacity of Liquid by Cooling

Specific heat capacities of liquids which react with water are often
measured by the so-called method of cooling. The cooling curve of a
calorimeter is plotted, first when it contained a known volume of hot
water, and then when it contains an equal volume of hot liquid (Fig. 9.4).
The volumes are made equal so as to make the temperature distribution,

the curves, the respective times t, and tw are found which the calorimeter
and contents take to cool from 6 X to 2 Whatever the contents of the
calorimeter, it gives off heat at a rate which depends only on its excess
temperature, since the area and nature, of its surface are constant.
Therefore, at each temperature between

Heat Capacity of Water by Continuous Flow Method

In 1899, Callendar and Barnes devised a method for specific heat
capacity in which only steady temperatures are measured. They used
platinum resistance thermometers, which are more accurate than
mercury ones but take more time to read. In the measurement of
steady temperatures, however, this is no drawback. As we shall see
shortly the heat capacity of the apparatus is not required, which is a
great advantage of the method.
Fig. 9.6 shows Callendar and Barnes' apparatus. Water from the
constant-head tank
flows through the glass tube U, and can be
collected as it flows out It is heated by the spiral resistance wire R,

When the apparatus is running, it settles down eventually to a steady
state, in which the heat supplied by the current is all carried away by
the water. None is then taken in warming the apparatus, because every
part of it is at a constant temperature. The mass of water m, which flows

Ice is one of the substances whose specific latent heat of fusion we
are likely to have to measure. To do so, place warm water, at a temperature 6 x a few degrees above room temperature, inside a calorimeter. Then
add small lumps of ice, dried by blotting paper, until the temperature
reaches a value 2 as much below room temperature as X was above.
In this case a 'cooling correction' is not necessary. Weigh the mixture,
to find the mass
of ice which has been added. Then the specific latent

no loss of heat from the specimen before it enters the calorimeter the specimen starts at room temperature, and therefore
gives up no heat until it enters the specimen tube (contrast the
method of mixtures, in which the specimen is heated to 100°C
or so) this is a great advantage when the specimen is small

the only temperature to be measured is the room temperature, which is constant
and can be determined at leisure.

An

advantage sometimes asserted is that specimens can be added
without having to re-set the apparatus. That is true,
because each specimen comes to 0°C in turn, and then behaves simply
like part of the apparatus, taking no heat from any following specimen.
But it does not mean that the calorimeter has the advantage of speed—
the time taken to set it up would be enough for half a dozen measurements by the method of mixtures. A disadvantage of this calorimeter is
that it never settles down completely
the mercury is always slowly
creeping along the capillary, and the creep during an experiment must
be estimated and allowed for.
The calorimeter was devised in 1871; it is rarely used nowadays,
because electrical methods of calorimetry are more convenient and
accurate. However, it has been used for measuring the specific heat
capacities of rare earths of which only small specimens were available.

Pressure and Volume: Boyle's

—

In 1660 Robert Boyle
whose epitaph reads 'Father of Chemistry,
and Nephew of the Earl of Cork' published the results of his experiments on the natural spring of air. In the vigorous language of the
seventeenth century, he meant what we now tamely call the relationship
between the pressure of air and its volume. Similar results were published in 1676 by Mariotte, who had not heard of Boyle's work. Boyle
trapped air in the closed limb of a U-tube, with mercury (Fig. 10.1 (a)).
He first adjusted the amount of mercury until its level was the same in
each limb, so that the trapped air was at atmospheric pressure. He next

air he had had to double the pressure on it.
We can repeat Boyle's experiment with the apparatus shown in
Fig. 10.1 (c); its form makes the pouring of mercury unnecessary. We
set the open limb of the tube at various heights above and below the
closed limb and measure the difference in level, h, of the mercury.
When the mercury in the open limb is below that in the closed, we
reckon h as negative. At each value of h we measure the corresponding

The cross-section S, and the distance between the divisions on which

Pressure and Temperature

The effect of temperature on the pressure of a gas, at constant
volume, was investigated by Amontons in 1702. His work was forgotten, however, and was re-discovered only after the work of GayLussac and Charles on the effect of temperature on volume.
An apparatus for measuring the pressure of a constant volume of
gas at various known temperatures is shown in Fig. 10.6 (a). The bulb B

contains air, which can be brought to any temperature
by heating
the water in the surrounding bath W. When the temperature is steady,
the mercury in the closed limb of the tube is brought to a fixed level D,
so that the volume of the air is fixed. The difference in level, h, of the
mercury in the open and closed limbs is then added to the height of the
barometer, H, to give the pressure p of the gas in cm of mercury.
If p, (h + H\ is plotted against the temperature, the plot is a straight
line (Fig. 10.6(b)).

A pressure of 760

of the atmosphere, is sometimes called 'standard' or 'normal' pressure.
A temperature of 0°C, or 273 K, is likewise called standard or normal
temperature. The conditions 273

pressure are together
called standard temperature and pressure (s.t.p.). A pressure of 760

A vogadro's Hypothesis: Molecular Weight
Amedeo Avogadro, with one simple-looking idea, illuminated
chemistry as Newton illuminated mechanics. In 1811 he suggested that
chemically active gases, such as oxygen, existed not as single atoms,
but as pairs: he proposed to distinguish between an atom, O, and a
molecule,
2 Ampere proposed the same distinction, independently,
in 1814. Avogadro also put forward another idea, now called Avogadro'
hypothesis: that equal volumes of all gases, at the same temperature
and pressure, contained equal numbers of molecules. The number of
3
molecules in lcm of gas at s.t.p. is called Loschmidt's number; it is

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

Avogadro's hypothesis became accepted in the middle of the nineteenth century. Because molecules could not be observed, their masses
could not be measured directly; but they could be compared, by
chemical methods. The molecular mass of a substance, /i, was at
defined as the ratio of the mass of its molecule, m, to the mass of
a hydrogen atom. Later, for the convenience of chemists, it was defined
as the ratio of the molecular mass to the mass of an imaginary atom,

KINETIC THEORY
The kinetic theory of matter, which regards all bodies as assemblies
of particles in motion either vibrating or flying about is an old one.
Lucretius described it in the first century a.d. and Gassendi and Hooke
revived it in the seventeenth century. In 1738 D. Bernoulli applied it

in detail to a gas, and from it deduced Boyle's law, which was already
Joiown from experiment. Another century passed, however, before
mainly by Clausius
the kinetic view of a gas was fully developed
(1822-88), Boltzmann (1844-1906), and Maxwell (1831-79).

—

In the kinetic theory of gases, we seek to explain the behaviour of
gases by considering the motion of their molecules. In particular, we
suppose that the pressure of a gas is due to the molecules bombarding

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

however, we assume that their collisions are perfectly elastic, both the
and the momentum are conserved in them. The average
momentum with which all the molecules strike the walls is then not
changed by their collisions with one another; what one loses, another
gains. The important effect of collisions between molecules is to
distribute their individual speeds on the average, the fast ones lose
speed to the slow. We suppose, then, that different molecules have
different speeds, and that the speeds of individual molecules vary with
time, as they make collisions with one another; but we also suppose
that the average speed of all the molecules is constant. These assumptions are justified by the fact that the kinetic theory leads to conclusions
which agree with experiment.

the speed of sound (1-30 km s
in hydrogen at 0°C); the speed of
sound is the speed with which the molecules of a gas pass on a disturbance from one to another, and this we may expect to be of the

When a gas passes through a porous plug, a cotton-wool wad, for
example, it is said to 'diffuse'. Diffusion differs from the flow of a gas
through a wide tube, in that it is not a motion of the gas in bulk, but is
a result of the motion of its individual molecules.

It is first filled with mercury, and inverted over

The volume of hydrogen, VH is proportional to
the length of the tube above the mercury. The
apparatus is now left hydrogen diffuses out through
P, and air diffuses in. Ultimately no hydrogen
remains in the tube D. The tube is then adjusted
until the level of mercury is again the same on

the new length of the tube above the mercury.

Thermal Agitations and Internal Energy

The random motion of the molecules of a gas, whose kinetic energy
depends upon the temperature, is often called the thermal agitation of
the molecules. And the kinetic energy of the thermal agitation is called
the internal energy of the gas. We must appreciate that this energy is
quite independent of any motion of the gas in bulk when a cylinder of
oxygen is being carried by an express train, its kinetic energy as a
whole is greater than when it is standing on the platform; but the
random motion of the molecules within the cylinder is unchanged
and so is the temperature of the gas. The same is true of a liquid in a
water-churning experiment to convert mechanical energy into heat,
baffles must be used to prevent the water from acquiring any massmotion all the work done must be converted into random motion,
if it is to appear as heat. Likewise, the internal energy of a solid is
the kinetic energy of its atoms' vibrations about their mean positions
throwing a lump of metal through the air does not raise its temperature,
but hitting it with a hammer does.

A diatomic molecule can have kinetic energy of rotation

about any axis at right-angles to its own. Its motion about any such axis can be
resolved into motions about two such axes at right-angles to each other (Fig.

molecule therefore has two degrees of rotational freedom. A polyatomic molecule,
unless it happens to consist of molecules all in a straight line, has no axis about
which its moment of inertia is negligible. It can therefore have kinetic energy of
rotation about three mutually perpendicular axes (Fig. 10.13 (b)). It has three
degrees of rotational freedom.
We have seen that the internal energy of a gas is shared between the translations
and rotations of its molecules. Maxwell assumed that the average kinetic energy
of a molecule, in each degree of freedom, rotational as well as translational,
was %kT. This assumption is called the principle of equipartition of energy; experiment shows, as we shall find, that it is true at room temperature and above.

Energy and Volume

In our simple account of the kinetic theory of gases, we have implicitly
assumed that the molecules of a gas do not attract one another. If they

any molecule approaching the boundary of the gas would be
body of it, as is a molecule of water approaching
the surface (see Chapter 6, Surface Tension, p. 128). The attractions of
the molecules would thus reduce the pressure of the gas.
Since the molecules of a substance are presumably the same whether
it is liquid or gas, the molecules of a gas must attract one another
somewhat. But except for brief instants when they collide, the molecules
of a gas are much further apart than those of a liquid. In 1 cubic centi19
molecules, and in 1 cubic
metre of gas at s.t.p. there are 2-69 x 10
22
there are a thousand times
centimetre of water there are 3-33 x 10
as many molecules in the liquid, and so the molecules in the gas are ten
times further apart. We may therefore expect that the mutual attraction
of the molecules of a gas, for most purposes, can be neglected, as
did,

experiment, in fact, shows.
The experiment consists in allowing a gas to expand without doing
external work; that is, to expand into a vacuum. Then, if the molecules
attract one another, work is done against their attractions, as they
move further apart But if the molecular attractions are negligible, the
work done is also negligible. If any work is done against the molecular
attractions, it will be done at the expense of the molecular kinetic
energies; as the molecules move apart, they will exert retarding forces
on one another. Thus the internal energy of the gas, and therefore its
temperature, will fall.
The expansion of a gas into a vacuum is called a 'free expansion'. If
a gas does not cool when it makes a free expansion, then the mutual
attractions of its molecules are negligible.

241

GASES
Joule's Experiments

Experiments on the free expansion of a gas were made in 1807 by
Gay-Lussac; they showed no fall in temperature. Joule repeated
these experiments with a better vacuum in 1845; he got the same negative result, and the greater accuracy of his experiments made them more
trustworthy. Joule used two forms of apparatus, as shown in Fig. 10.14
(a) and (b). Each consisted of a cylinder of air, R, at 22 atmospheres,
connected by a stop-cock S to an evacuated cylinder E. In the apparatus
(a) both cylinders stood in the same tin can C, which contained 16j lb
water. In (b) the cylinders stood in different cans, and the stop-cock in
a third, also containing water. When the stop-cock was opened, gas
expanded from R to E. With the apparatus (a) Joule found, after stirring
the water, that its temperature was unchanged. The expanding gas had
therefore neither liberated heat nor absorbed it. With the apparatus (b)
Joule found that heat was absorbed from the water round R, and given
to the water round S and E; the heat given out was equal to the heat

R, expanding against the rising pressure of the gas in E and in the pipe
beyond S. The heat given out represented the work done on the gas in
E and S by the gas flowing in, against the rising pressure. The equality

mass of gas neither gained nor lost
expansion. Joule's experiments, therefore,
showed that the internal energy of a gas is independent of its volume.
From Joule's results we may argue back to show that the mutual
attractions of the molecules of the gas are negligible; in practice,
however, it is the property of the bulk gas which is important

Joule's experiments, though more reliable than Gay-Lussac's, were
crude; with so much water, a small amount of heat would not produce
a measurable temperature rise. Between 1852 and 1862, Joule worked
with William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, on more delicate experifact that its internal

If the internal energy of a gas is independent of its volume, it is
determined only by the temperature of the gas. The simple expression
for the pressure, p = %pc 2 then holds; and the gas obeys Boyle's and
Charles's laws. Its pressure coefficient, a v is equal to its volume

Molecules have a particular diameter or volume because repulsive
when they approach very closely and hence they can not
be compressed indefinitely. The volume of the space inside a container
occupied by the molecules is thus not V but (V—b), where b is a factor
depending on the actual volume of the molecules.
If the attractive forces between molecules are not negligible, the
molecules approaching the container walls are attracted by the molecules behind them. This reduces the momentum of the approaching
molecules and hence the pressure. The observed pressure p is thus less
than the ideal gas pressure, where there are no molecular forces, by a

Below this temperature, however, isotherms such as EABF are
obtained by using van der Waals' equation. These are unlike the isotherms obtained with real gases, because in the region AB the pressure
increases with the volume, which is impossible. However, an actual
isotherm in this region corresponds to a straight line EF, as shown.
Here the liquid and vapour are in equilibrium (see p. 317) and the line
EF is drawn to make the shaded areas above and below it equal.
Thus van der Waals' equation roughly fits the isotherms of actual gases
above the critical temperature but below the critical temperature it
must be modified considerably. Many other gas equations have been
suggested for real gases but quantitative agreement is generally poor.

When we warm a gas, we may let it expand or not, as we please. If

If we allow a gas to expand as we warm it, then it does external work.
The heat we give the gas appears partly as an increase to its internal

The ratio of the specific heat capacities of a gas thus gives us a measure of the
number of atoms in its molecule, at least when that number is less than three.
This ratio is fairly easy to measure, as we shall see later in this chapter. The poor
agreement between the observed and theoretical values of y for some of the
polyatomic gases shows

that, in its application to

such gases, the theory

of a gas at constant volume, called a differential steam calorimeter.
The calorimeter consists of two copper globes, A and B, as nearly
identical as they can be made. They hang from the beam of a balance,
and are surrounded by a chest C into which steam can be admitted
at D. The sphere B is evacuated and A is filled with the gas whose
specific heat is required. By filling A to a high pressure, the mass of
gas can be made great enough to be accurately measurable on the
balance. Let its value be M. Steam is now admitted to the chest, and
condenses on both globes until they reach the temperature of the

steam. This will generally be about 100°C, but we shall denote it by B v
The balance measures the excess steam condensed on A, over that
condensed on B; let its mass by
y If the globes are identical, their
heat capacities are equal, and the masses of steam required to warm
the globes alone are equal. The excess steam condensed on A is then the

The calorimeter is called 'differential' for the reason that it measures
the difference in mass of the steam on the two globes. This is an important feature of it, because the heat capacities of the globes may be

much greater than that of the gas. If a single globe were used, two
measurements would have to be made, one with and one without the

The mass of steam condensed by the gas would then appear as the
difference of two nearly equal masses, and could not be determined
accurately. In practice the globes are not identical, and a control
experiment with both evacuated is made to find the difference in mass
of the steam condensed on them. This appears as a small correction to

A small correction has also to be made to the result of the experiment,

CHANGES OF PRESSURE, VOLUME AND TEMPERATURE
In, for example, a steam engine or motor, gases expand and are
compressed, cool and are heated, in ways more complicated than those
which we have already described. We shall now consider some of these
ways.

given mass of the given gas, at the temperature T. Fig. 10.19 shows a
family of isothermals, for 1 g of air at different temperatures. When a
gas expands, or is compressed, at constant temperature, its pressure
and volume vary along the appropriate isothermal, and the gas is said
to undergo an isothermal compression or expansion.

does work for example, in driving a piston
(Fig. 10.9, p. 229). The molecules of the gas bombard the piston, and
if the piston moves they give up some of their kinetic energy to it
when a molecule bounces off a moving piston, it does so with a velocity
less in magnitude than that with which it struck. The change in velocity
is small, because the piston moves much more slowly than the molecule
but there are many molecules striking the piston at any instant, and
their total loss of kinetic energy is equal to the work done in driving
the piston forward.
The work done by a gas in expanding, therefore, is done at the
expense of its internal energy. The temperature of the gas will consequently fall during expansion, unless heat is supplied to it. For an
isothermal expansion, the gas. must be held in a thin- walled, highly
conducting vessel, surrounded by a constant temperature bath. And
the expansion must take place slowly, so that heat can pass into the
gas to maintain its temperature at every instant during the expansion.

us consider an isothermal compression. When a gas is
compressed, work is done on it by the compressing agent. To keep its
temperature constant, therefore, heat must be withdrawn from the
gas, to prevent the work done from increasing its internal energy. The
gas must again be held in a thin well-conducting vessel, surrounded
by a constant-temperature bath ; and it must be compressed slowly.
The conditions for an isothermal compression or expansion of a gas
are difficult to realize; heat cannot flow through the walls of the vessel
unless there is at least a small difference of temperature across them,
and therefore the temperature of the gas is bound to rise a little in
compression, or to fall a little in expansion.

change can be reversed so that the state of the gas is returned
from p 2 V2 Tto p lf Vlt T through exactly the same values of pressure
and volume at every stage, then the isothermal change is said to be
reversible. A reversible isothermal change is an ideal one. It requires
conditions such as a light frictionless piston, so that the pressure
inside and outside the gas can always be equalised and no work is
done against friction; very slow expansion, so that no eddies are
produced in the gas to dissipate the energy and a constant temperature
reservoir with very thin good-conducting walls, as we have seen. In a
reversible isothermal change, pV —constant = RT.

Equation for Reversible Adiabatic change
Let us now consider a change of volume in which the conditions are
opposite extreme from isothermal; no heat is allowed to enter

at the

or leave the gas.
An expansion or contraction in which no heat enters or leaves the
gas is called an adiabatic expansion or contraction. In an adiabatic
expansion, the external work is done wholly at the expense of the
internal energy of the gas, and the gas therefore cools. In an adiabatic
compression, all the work done on the gas by the compressing agent
appears as an increase in its internal energy and therefore as a rise in
its temperature. We have already discussed a reversible isothermal
change. A reversible adiabatic change is an adiabatic change which can
be exactly reversed in the sense explained on p. 251. As noted there, a

and volume for a given mass of a given
gas for adiabatic changes is called an 'adiabatic'. In Fig. 10.20, the
heavy curve is an adiabatic for 1 g of air; it is steeper, at any point,
than the isothermal through that point. The curve AB is the isothermal
for the temperature T = 373 K, which cuts the adiabatic at the

is steeper than the isothermal. We will
equation shortly.
The condition for an adiabatic change is that no heat must enter or
leave the gas. The gas must therefore be held in a thick-walled, badly
conducting vessel; and the change of volume must take place rapidly,
to give as little time as possible for heat to escape. However, in a rapid
compression, for example,, eddies may be formed, so that some of the
work done appears as kinetic energy of the gas in bulk, instead of as
random kinetic energy of its molecules. All the work done then does
not go to increase the internal energy of the gas, and the temperature
rise is less than in a truly adiabatic compression. If the compression
is made slowly, then more heat leaks out, since no vessel has perfectly

Perfectly adiabatic changes are therefore impossible; and so, we
have seen, are perfectly isothermal ones. Any practical expansion or
compression of a gas must lie between isothermal and adiabatic. It
may lie anywhere between them, but if it approximates to isothermal,
the curve representing it will always be a little steeper than, the ideal
(Fig. 10.21); if it approximates to adiabatic, the curve representing it
will never be quite as steep as the ideal.

Equation of Reversible Adiabatic
Before considering adiabatic changes in particular,- let us first;
consider a change of volume and temperature which takes place in anarbitrary manner. For simplicity, we consider .unit mass of; the gas,
and we suppose that its volume expands from V to V +SV, and that
an amount of heat 5Q is supplied to it In general, the internal energy
of the gas will increase by an amount SU. And the gas will do an amount
of external work equal to pdV, where p is its pressure. The heat supplied
is equal to the increase in internal energy, plus the external work done

Measurement of y.
In books on Sound, it is shown that sound waves are propagated
through a gas by rapid compressions and rarefactions these changes
in pressure and volume are adiabatic. In consequence, the velocity of
sound in a gas depends upon the ratio of the specific heat capacities
of the gas, y; and the value of y can be found from measurements of
the velocity of sound in the gas. This is the most convenient way of
measuring y.
A direct measurement of y can be made by the method of Clement
and Desormes (1819). A large vessel such as a carboy contains the
gas, which in a teaching experiment is usually air (Fig. 10.22). The

To develop a

in, there is no space between it and the
bottom of the barrel. We suppose that the pump is connected to a
vessel of volume V that the piston displaces a volume VP and that
the pressure in the vessel is p when the piston is right in, at the start
of the evacuation. When the piston is pulled right out, the volume of
the air originally in the vessel increases to V + VP Since the action

According

to this theory, the final pressure tends to zero as the

a limiting pressure. This is due to the fact that the piston can never in
practice be brought right down to the valve F x , so that there is a
residual volume, or dead-space, v, between the piston and the bottom
of the barrel. Air can escape through the valve F 2 only when the pressure
in the volume v is greater than atmospheric. And air can pass from the
vessel through F x only when the pressure in the barrel is less than the
pressure in the vessel. Thus the limiting pressure, p^, is the pressure

Rotary Pumps
Fig. 10.26 illustrates one form of rotary vacuum pump. It consists of
a rotor, R, which turns eccentrically in a casing, C, being a close fit at
the ends and along the line A. The rotor carries two scraping blades
B ls B 2 separated by a strong spring. The vessel to be avacuated is
connected to the inlet port I, and the outlet port
is fitted with a
valve N. As the rotor turns, the volume Vx increases, so that air expands
from the vessel into the pump. When the blades are in the positions
shown, the air in the space V2 is being compressed; when its pressure
rises to atmospheric, the valve
opens, and the air passes out through
O. As the blade B 2 crosses the seat of the valve N, the valve closes

because the air in V3 is below atmospheric pressure. Thus atmospheric
air cannot blow back into the pump. The lines of contact, A, D, E are
made airtight by a film of oil. All the working parts of the pump are
enclosed in a tank T containing oil. When the pump is at rest, the oil
seeps back through the outlet valve and fills the working space; but
the first revolutions of the pump sweep out the excess oil, and leave
just the necessary film over the metal surfaces.
A single rotary pump will give an ultimate pressure of about 001
mercury. Very often two pumps are housed in the same tank of
oil, and driven off the same shaft; they are connected in cascade, and
may give an ultimate pressure of less than 0001
mercury.

The MacLeod Gauge
The MacLeod Gauge

is a gauge used for measuring pressures below
mercury; these are pressures which cannot be measured
accurately on a U-tube manometer. It consists of a bulb B, connected
to a mercury reservoir
and terminated in a capillary tube T (Fig.
10.27 (a)); just below the bulb a branch-tube, P, leads to the vacuum
system under test. It also carries a branch-tube, D, which is a capillary
of the same bore as T. A millimetre scale, S, lies underneath T and D.
To measure the pressure in a vacuum system, the reservoir
is
lowered until the mercury falls below the branch-point C. The air in

is raised until the mercury in B just reaches
the foot of the capillary T. The height h of the mercury in D, above
that in B, is then measured. The purpose of having equal bores for
T and D is to equalize surface tension effects in each.
If the pressure p is expressed in
mercury then the pressure of
the air trapped in T is p + h. The volume of this air is the volume v
of the capillary T. At the moment when the mercury passed the point
C, this air had the pressure p, and the volume V+v, where V is the

Accurate Measurement of Expansion

An instrument for accurately measuring the length of a bar, at a
controlled temperature, is called a comparator (Fig. 11.2). It consists
of two microscopes,

First the substandard metre is run under the microscopes, and the
temperature of its bath is adjusted to that at which the bar was calibrated (usually about 18°C).
When the temperature of the bar is steady, the eyepiece webs are
adjusted to intersect the scratches on its ends (Fig. 11.2 (b)), and their
micrometers are read The distance between the cross-webs is then

again measured. In this way the length can be measured at small
intervals of temperature, and the mean linear expansivity, or the
coefficients a, b, c in equation (2), can be determined.
Expansion at High Temperatures
Fig. 11.3 illustrates the principle of a method for measuring the
expansion of a solid at high temperatures. A is a tube of fused silica,

having a scale S engraved on the edge of an opening,
H, in its side. B is the specimen, and C is a rod of fused
silica with a second scale S' engraved on it.
The thermal expansion of fused silica is much less
than that of most solids, over a given temperature
range, and has been accurately measured by a method
depending on optical interference. When the apparatus
shown is placed in a high-temperature bath, the
rod C rises by an amount equal to the difference in
expansion of the specimen, and an equal length of
fused silica Its rise is measured by observing the
displacement of the scale S' relative to S through a
microscope.

By a suitable choice of lengths and materials, the distance BB' can
be made to vary with temperature in any one of the following ways
(1) The bar AB' is made of invar, a nickel-steel whose linear expansivity is very small (p. 270). The point B' then does not move with
changes in temperature. In equation (4) we neglect X', and find

Temperature Compensation

The rate of a clock varies considerably with temperature, unless
arrangements are made to prevent its doing so. If the clock is governed
by a pendulum, the length of the pendulum increases with temperature,
its period therefore also increases, and the clock loses. A clock governed
by a balance-wheel and hair-spring also loses as the temperature rises.
For, as the temperature rises, the spring becomes less stiff, and the
period of the balance-wheel increases. Also the spokes of the wheel
expand a little, increasing the moment of inertia of the wheel, and
thus further increasing its period.
A balance-wheel clock may be compensated against temperature
changes by making the circumference of the
wheel in the form of two or three bimetal
strips, as

shown

in Fig. 11.10.

The

strips

carry small weights W, to give the wheel
the necessary moment of inertia. As the
temperature rises, the strips curl inwards,
and bring the weights nearer to the axle;
thus the moment of inertia of the wheel
decreases. In a correctly designed timingsystem, the decrease in moment of inertia

offsets the decrease in stiffness of the
just
wheel.
spring, and then the period of the balancewheel does not change with temperature.
Many modern watches are not compensated. Their balance-wheels
are made of invar, which, as we have seen, has a very small coefficient
of expansion. Another nickel-steel, of slightly different composition,
is used for their hair-springs. This alloy changes its elasticity very
little with temperature, and is called elinvar. The combination of
invar balance-wheel and elinvar hair-spring gives a rate which is
nearly enough independent of temperature for everyday purposes.

Metal-Glass Seals
In radio valves and many other pieces of physical apparatus, it is
necessary to seal metal cones into glass tubes, with a vacuum-tight
joint The seal must be made at about 400°C, when the glass is soft;
as it cools to room temperature, the glass will crack unless the glass
and metal contract at the same rate. This condition requires that
the metal and the glass have the same linear expansivity at every

temperature between

X = 3-4xl(T 6 perdegC).
Modern seals through soft glass are not made with platinum, but
with a wire of nickel-iron alloy, which has about the same linear
coefficient as the glass. The wire has a thin coating of copper, which
adheres to glass more firmly than the alloy. Also, being soft, the copper
takes up small differences in expansion between the alloy and the glass.
In transmitting valves, and large vacuum plants, glass and metal
tubes several centimetres in diameter must be joined end-to-end. The
metal tubes are made of copper, chamfered to a fine taper at the end
where the joint is to be made. The glass is sealed on to the edge of the
chamfer the copper there is thin enough to distort, with the difference
in contraction, without cracking the glass.

LIQUIDS
Cubic Expansivity

The temperature of a liquid determines its volume, but its vessel
determines its shape. The only expansivity which we can define for
a liquid is therefore its cubic expansivity, y. Most liquids, like most
solids, do not expand uniformly, and y is not constant over a wide

under high pressure. All the hot columns were beside one another in
a hot oil bath kept at a constant high temperature, while the cold

columns were similarly placed in a bath of melting ice. Platinum
resistance thermometers were used to measure the temperatures, and
a cathetometer to measure the heights and difference in level.

Apparent Expansion: Weight Thermometer Method

The method

slow and awkward; it has only been applied to mercury.
Routine measurements are more conveniently made by measuring the
apparent expansion; from this, as we shall see, the absolute expansion
can be calculated.
A weight thermometer is a bulb of fused quartz fitted with a fine
stem (Fig. 11.15). It is filled with liquid at a low temperature, and then

the thermometer should be boiled at intervals during the filling, to
expel dissolved air. In a laboratory experiment, a glass density bottle
may be used, filled in the usual way.

The weight thermometer must be filled at a temperature slightly
below the lower limit, 9 X of the range over which the expansion is to
be measured. It is then kept in a bath at 9 X until no more liquid flows
out. Next it is weighed, and from its known mass when empty the
mass of liquid in it is found. Let this be m x The weight thermometer is
then placed in a bath at the higher temperature of the range, 2 and the

Coefficient of Weight-thermometer Material

The cubic expansivity of a glass weight-thermometer may not be
accurately known, because glasses differ considerably in their physical
properties. Also the expansivity may be changed when the glass is
heated in the blowing of the bulb. The expansivity can conveniently be
measured, however, by using the weight thermometer to find the
apparent value for mercury; and then subtracting the value found
from the known value of the absolute expansivity of mercury.

Expansion of a Powder

The weight thermometer can be used to find the cubic expansivity
of a granular or powdery solid, such as sand. The procedure is the
same as in finding the relative density of the solid, but is gone through
at two known temperatures. From the change in relative density, and
a knowledge of the expansions of the liquid and the weight thermometer, the change in absolute density of the

The Anomalous Expansion of Water
If we nearly fill a tall jar with water, and float lumps of ice on it, the
water at the base of the jar does not cool below 4°C, although the
water at the top soon reaches 0°C. At 4°C water has its greatest density
as it cools to this temperature it sinks to the bottom. When the water
at the top cools below 4°C, it becomes less dense than the water below,
and stays on the top. Convection ceases, and the water near the bottom
of the jar can lose heat only by conduction. Since water is a bad conductor, the loss by conduction is extremely small, and in practice the
water at the bottom does not cool below 4 C. The same happens in a
pond, cooled at the top by cold air. Ice forms at the surface, but a little
below it the water remains at 4°C, and life in the pond survives. It

Changes of State. Vapours
SOLID TO liquid: fusion
The Solid State
Substances exist in the solid, liquid or gaseous state. In the solid
a body has a regular, geometrical structure. Sometimes this
structure gives the body a regular outward form, as in a crystal of
alum; sometimes, as in a strand of wool, it does not. But X-rays can
reveal to us the arrangement of the individual atoms or molecules in
a solid; and whether the solid is wool or alum, we find that its atoms
or molecules are arranged in a regular pattern. This pattern we call a
space-lattice; its form may be simple, as in metals, or complicated, as
in wool, proteins, and other chemically complex substances.
We consider that the atoms or molecules of a solid are vibrating
about their mean positions in its space-lattice. And we consider that
the kinetic energy of their vibrations increases with the temperature
of the solid its increase is the heat energy supplied to cause the rise
in temperature. When the temperature reaches the melting-point, the
solid liquefies. Lindemann has suggested that, at the melting-point,
the atoms or molecules vibrate so violently that they collide with one
another. The attractive forces between them can then no longer hold

The Liquid State
In the liquid state, a body has no form, but a fixed volume. It adapts
the shape of its vessel, but does not expand to fill it. We consider
that its molecules still dart about at random, as in the gaseous state,
itself to

temperature. But we think that they are now close enough together

liquid evaporates even in cold weather, a pool of water does not last

well-defined plateau in the cooling curve indicates the freezing (or

molecules of the liquid lose their kinetic energy as it cools, but do
not take up the rigid geometric pattern of the solid. Shaking or stirring
the liquid, or dropping grit or dust into it, may cause it to solidify;
but dropping in a crystal of its own solid is more likely to make it
solidify. As soon as the substance begins to solidify, it returns to its
melting (or freezing) point. The melting-point is the only temperature at
which solid and liquid can be in equilibrium.
No one has succeeded in warming a solid above its melting-point
or, if he has, he has failed to report his success. We may therefore
suppose that to superheat a solid is not possible and we need not be
surprised For the melting-point of a solid is the temperature at which
its atoms or molecules have enough kinetic energy to break up its
crystal lattice: as soon as the molecules are moving fast enough, they
burst from their pattern On the other hand, when a liquid cools to its
melting-point, there is no particular reason why its molecules should
spontaneously arrange themselves. They may readily do so, however,
around a crystal in which their characteristic pattern is already set up.

require a greater pressure than can be realized. Most substances swell

Freezing of Solutions

Water containing a dissolved substance freezes below 0°C. The
depression of the freezing-point increases at first with the concentration, but eventually reaches a maximum. The lowest freezing-point of
common salt solution is — 22°C, when the solution contains about
one-quarter of its weight of salt. When a solution does freeze, pure ice
separates out; an easy way of preparing pure water is therefore to
freeze it, remove the ice, and then melt the ice. The water which is
mixed with the ice in determining the ice-point of a thermometer must

LIQUID TO GAS! EVAPORATION
Evaporation differs from melting in that it takes place at all temperatures; as long as the weather is dry, a puddle will always clear up.
In cold weather the puddle lasts longer than in warm, as the rate of

rapidly with the temperature.

Solids as well as liquids evaporate. Tungsten evaporates

can be particularly well seen on the headlamp bulb of a bicycle dynamo
set, if it has been frequently over-run through riding down-hill. The
rate of evaporation of a solid is negligible at temperatures well below
its melting-point, as we may see from the fact that bars of metal do not

Saturated and Unsaturated Vapours

shows an apparatus with which we can study vapours
A is a glass tube, about a metre long, dipping in a
mercury trough and backed by a scale S. Its upper end carries a bulb
B, which is fitted with three taps T, of which T x and T2 should be as
close together as possible. Above Tj is a funnel F. With T 1 closed but
T2 open, we evacuate the bulb and tube through T 3 with a rotary
pump. If the apparatus is clean, the mercury in A rises to the barometer
height H. Meanwhile we put some ether in the funnel F. When the
apparatus is evacuated, we close T 3 and T 2 We now open and close T t
so that a little ether flows into the space C. Lastly, we open T 2 so that
the ether evaporates into the bulb B. As it does so, the mercury in A
falls, showing that the ether- vapour is exerting a pressure (Fig. 12.4 (b)).
If h is the new height of the mercury in A, then the pressure of the vapour
in mm of mercury is equal to H — h.

But we reach a point at which the introduction of more ether does not
increase the pressure, the height of the mercury column remains
constant at h'. At this point we notice that liquid ether appears above
the mercury in A (Fig. 12.4 (c)). We say that the vapour in B is now
saturated; a saturated vapour is one that is in contact with its own liquid.
Before the liquid appeared in the above experiment, the pressure of
the vapour could be increased by introducing more ether, and we say
that the vapour in B was then unsaturated.

saturated vapour does not increase its pressure, but merely makes
some of it condense to liquid.
Similarly, if we lower the reservoir M, to increase the volume of the
vapour, we do not decrease its pressure. Its pressure stays constant,
but the volume of liquid above the mercury now decreases; liquid

evaporates, and keeps the vapour saturated. If we increase the volume
of the vapour until all the liquid has evaporated, then the pressure of
the vapour begins to

Effect of Temperature: Validity of Gas-laws for

Vapours

We cannot heat the apparatus of Fig. 12.4 through any great rise of
temperature. But we can warm it with our hands, or by pointing an
we do warm it, we find that the ether above the
mercury evaporates further, and the pressure of the vapour increases.
Experiments which we shall describe later show that the pressure of a
saturated vapour rises, with the temperature, at a rate much greater
than that given by Charles's law. Its rise is roughly exponential.
To Boyle's law, saturated vapours are indifferent: their pressure is
independent of their volume. Unsaturated vapours obey Boyle's law
roughly, as they also obey roughly Charles's law. Fig. 12.5 (a). Vapours,
saturated and unsaturated, are gases in that they spread throughout
their vessels; but we find it convenient to distinguish them by name
from gases such as air, which obey Charles's and Boyle's laws closely.

Kinetic Theory of Saturation

Let us consider a vapour in contact with its
an otherwise empty vessel which is closed
by a piston (Fig. 12.7). The molecules of the vapour,
we suppose, are rushing randomly about, like the
molecules of a gas, with kinetic energies whose
average value is determined by the temperature of
the vapour. They bombard the walls of the vessel,
giving rise to the pressure of the vapour, and they
also bombard the surface of the liquid.

liquid, in

The molecules of the liquid, we further suppose, Fig. 12.7. Dynamic
equilibrium,
are also rushing about with kinetic energies determined by the temperature of the liquid. The fastest of them escape from
the surface of the liquid. At the surface, therefore, there are molecules
leaving the liquid, and molecules arriving from the vapour. To complete
our picture of the conditions at the surface, we suppose that the vapour
as they are at the walls of
molecules bombarding it are not reflected

be,

We

assume that the liquid and vapour have the same temperathe proportions of liquid and vapour will not change, if
the temperature and the total volume are kept constant. Therefore, at
the surface of the liquid, molecules must be arriving and departing
at the same rate, and hence evaporation from the liquid is balanced
by condensation from the vapour. This state of affairs is called a
dynamic equilibrium. In terms of it, we can explain the behaviour of a

Then

saturated vapour.

The rate at which molecules leave unit area of the liquid depends
simply on their average kinetic energy, and therefore on the temperature. The rate at which molecules strike unit area of the liquid, from
the vapour, likewise depends on the temperature; but it also depends
on the concentration of the molecules in the vapour, that is to say,
on the density of the vapour. The density and temperature of the
vapour also determine its pressure the rate of bombardment therefore
depends on the pressure of the vapour.
;

Now

us suppose that we decrease the volume of the vessel in
by pushing in the piston. Then we momentarily increase the
density of the vapour, and hence the number of its molecules striking
the liquid surface per second. The rate of condensation thus becomes
greater than the rate of evaporation, and the liquid grows at the
expense of the vapour. As the vapour condenses its density falls, and
so does the rate of condensation. The dynamic equilibrium is restored
when the rate of condensation, and the density of the vapour, have
returned to their original values. The pressure of the vapour will then
also have returned to its original value. Thus the pressure of a saturated
vapour is independent of its volume. The proportion of liquid to vapour,
however, increases as the volume decreases.

of which only a small quantity can be had. A few drops of the liquid
are imprisoned by mercury in the closed limb of the tube, all entrapped
air having been shaken out (Fig. 12.8 (c)). The tube is then heated in a
bath, and the temperature observed at which the mercury comes to the
same level in both limbs. The bath is warmed a little further, and then
a second observation made as the bath cools; the mean of the two
observations is taken as the boiling-point of the liquid.
Boiling differs from evaporation in that a liquid evaporates from its
surface alone, but it boils throughout its volume. If we ignore the
small hydrostatic pressure of the liquid itself, we may say that the
pressure throughout a vessel of liquid is the atmospheric pressure.
Therefore, when the saturated vapour pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, a bubble of vapour can form anywhere in the liquid.

the equation

= Pa +hpg + 2y
If the radius r is small, the term 2y/r is great, and the bubble cannot
form unless the vapour pressure is considerably above atmospheric.
In fact the equation shows that a bubble can never start from zero
radius, because it would require an infinite vapour pressure to do so.
Bubbles actually form on roughnesses in the vessel, or specks of solid
suspended in the liquid. Very clean water in a very smooth beaker may
not boil until it is well above 100°C; its bubbles then grow violently,
and the liquid 'bumps' in the beaker. A piece of broken pipe-clay prevents bumping, by presenting fine points for the bubbles to form on.
Thus the temperature of a boiling liquid is not definite it depends
on the conditions of boiling. But the temperature of the vapour is
definite. The vapour escaping is in equilibrium with the liquid at the
surface, and is at atmospheric pressure. Its temperature, therefore, is
the temperature at which the saturated vapour pressure is equal to the
atmospheric pressure. This idea is important in defining the upper
fixed point of the temperature scale (p. 190). We say that the upper
fixed point is the temperature of the steam from water boiling under
a pressure of 760
mercury. We must not refer to the temperature
of the water, and we must specify the atmospheric pressure because
as we have just seen, it determines the temperature of the steam.

Variation of Saturated Vapour Pressure with Temperature

We can now see how the relationship between the pressure of a
saturated vapour and its temperature can be measured. We must
apply various known air pressures to the liquid, heat the liquid, and
measure the temperature of its vapour. Fig. 12.10 shows a suitable
apparatus, due to Regnault. The flask F contains the liquid, water in

gently. The water vapour condenses in the condenser, and runs back
to the flask. After a few minutes the water boils steadily. The temperature
of the vapour, 6, and the pressure, p, become constant and we record
their values. We next remove the flame from the flask F, and let the
apparatus cool for a minute or two. Then we withdraw some more air
from R, close T again, and repeat the observations.

Boiling Point of a Solution

At a given pressure, the boiling-point of water containing a dissolved
substance is higher than that of pure water. The temperature of the
steam evolved from the solution, however, is the temperature of
saturated steam at the prevailing pressure. Traces of dissolved substances in the water therefore do not affect the steam point in thermometry.
Since a liquid boils when its saturated vapour pressure is equal to
the atmospheric pressure, we must conclude that dissolving a substance
in water lowers its saturated vapour pressure, at a given temperature
(Fig. 12.11). We may explain this by supposing that the molecules of
the dissolved substance, which do not evaporate, hinder the escape of
the molecules of the water.

boiling point of water falls with increasing height. Cooking-pots for
use in high mountainous districts, such as the Andes, are therefore

with clamped lids. As the water boils, the steam accumulates in
and its pressure rises above atmospheric. At about 760
mercury a safety valve opens, so that the pressure does not rise above
that value, and the cooking is done at 100°C.
The fall in the boiling-point with atmospheric pressure gives a simple
way of determining one's height above sea-level. One observes the
steam point with a thermometer and hypsometer (p. 190). Knowing
how the steam point falls with pressure, and how atmospheric pressure
falls with increasing height, one can then find one's altitude. The hypsometer was, in fact, devised for this purpose, and takes its name from it

the heat required to vaporize unit mass of it at its normal
boiling-point, that is to say, under normal atmospheric pressure.
But since evaporation takes place at all temperatures, the latent heat
has a value for every temperature. Regnault measured the latent heat
of steam over a range of temperatures, by boiling water at controlled
pressures, as in measuring its saturated vapour pressure. His apparatus
was in principle similar to Berthelot's (Fig. 9.10); but he connected the
outlet tube to an air reservoir, manometer, and pump, as in Fig. 12.10.

Density of a Saturated Vapour

In any experiment to measure the density
of a saturated vapour, the vessel containing
the vapour must also contain some liquid, to
ensure that the vapour is saturated. The

problem is therefore to find how much of the
total mass is vapour, and how much is liquid.
Fig. 12.12 shows one method of solving this
problem, due to Cailletet and Mathias.

true of saturated vapours, but it is roughly true of vapours which are far from
saturation. To find die molecular weight of a substance which is liquid at room
temperature, therefore, we must vaporize it, and measure the density of its vapour
when it is as far from saturation as we can conveniently get it.

A glass bulb B, with a long thin stem, is weighed

by plunging the bulb into a bath at a temperature about 40°C above its boilingpoint. It then evaporates rapidly, and its vapour sweeps the air out of the bulb.
When vapour has stopped coming out, the stem is sealed with a flame: the bulb
now contains nothing but the vapour, at the temperature 9 and under atmospheric
pressure.

The bulb is removed, allowed to cool, dried, and weighed. The stem is then

WATER-VAPOUR IN THE ATMOSPHERE!
HYGROMETRY
The water vapour in the atmosphere is important because it affects
our comfort Except in cold weather, we sweat continuously: the
water in the sweat evaporates, draws its latent heat of evaporation
from the skin, and so keeps us cool. Beads of sweat appear only when
the water cannot evaporate as fast as it reaches the surface of the skin
we then feel uncomfortably hot.
On the other hand, if water evaporates from the skin too rapidly,
the skin feels parched and hard; around the mucous membranes
at
the mouth and nose
it tends to crack.
The rate at which water evaporates, from the skin or anywhere else,
depends on the pressure of the water vapour surrounding it. If the
water vapour above the skin is far from saturated, evaporation is swift.
If the vapour is already saturated, water reaching the skin comes
immediately into dynamic equilibrium with it; individual molecules
are exchanged between liquid and vapour, but no mass of liquid is lost,
and water accumulates.

The

Partial Pressure of Atmospheric

Water

The atmosphere contains other gases besides water-vapour, such as
oxygen and nitrogen In speaking of the water-vapour, therefore, we
must refer to its 'partial pressure', as explained on p. 222.
Water-vapour in the atmosphere is also important because it affects
the weather. Let us suppose that the atmosphere has a temperature
of 20°C
and that the water vapour in it has a partial

pressure of 12 mm mercury. It will have a density of about 12 mg per
litre. The density of saturated water vapour at 20°C is 17-3 mg per litre,
and its pressure 17-5 mm mercury. The water vapour in the atmosphere

—

is

—

therefore not saturated.

Now

us suppose that the atmosphere cools to 14°C, without
composition The 6°C fall in temperature will hardly affect
the density of the water vapour, but it will bring the atmosphere to

Relative Humidity

The dampness of the atmosphere, besides affecting the weather and
our comfort, is important also in storage and manufacture of many
substances
tobacco and cotton, for example. From what we have
said already, we can see that the important factor is not the actual
proportion of water vapour in the atmosphere, but its nearness to
saturation In the above example, the density of the vapour remained
almost constant, but we would have felt the atmosphere becoming
much damper as it cooled from 20°C to 14°C.
The dampness of the atmosphere is expressed by its relative humidity,

Before describing the methods of measurement, we must warn the
reader against thinking that the atmosphere 'takes up' water vapour.
The atmosphere is not a sponge. Water-vapour exists in it in its own
right; and our knowledge of vapours makes us feel sure that, if we
could live in an atmosphere of water-vapour alone, we would have
just the same experiences of humidity as we now have in our happily
richer surroundings.

Then, on smooth surfaces such as metals, we often find
a thin film of moisture. The surface has cooled to such a temperature
that the water vapour in contact with it has become saturated, and has
begun to condense. No fog has formed because the atmosphere in
general is warmer than the cold solid, and the vapour in it is not saturated. The temperature of a cold surface on which dew just appears is
called the dew-point it is the temperature at which the saturated vapourpressure of water is equal to the partial pressure of the water-vapour

Heat, to Regnault. It consists of
two glass tubes, A, B, with silverplated thimbles C,
cemented
on to their lower ends. C contains
ether, into which dips a thermometer T and a glass tube R (Fig.
12.14). To use the hygrometer, we
first place a sheet of glass between
it and ourselves, to prevent our
breath from adding to the humidity of the air around it. We then

pass

a gentle stream of coal-gas, and burn it at the end of a long tube
connected to the outlet S.) The gas or air passing through the ether
carries away its vapour, and makes it evaporate continuously. In
doing so it cools, since it must provide its latent heat of evaporation
from its own heat content When the ether has cooled to the dew-point,
a film of mist appears on the thimble C; the thimble
enables us to
notice this more sharply, by contrast At the moment when the dew
appears, the thermometer T is read. The flow of air or gas through the
ether is stopped, and the ether allowed to warm up. The temperature
at which the dew vanishes is noted, and the mean of this and the temperature at which it appeared is taken as the dew-point #i say. By so
doing we correct reasonably well for any difference of temperature
between the ether and the outer surface of the tube. Lastly, we take the
temperature of the room, 2, often from a thermometer (not shown) in
B, and look up the saturation pressures at

The wet-and-dry-bulb hygrometer is not very reliable when used in
a simple screen. It is more accurate if a steady stream of air is driven
past it by a fan, or by whirling the thermometers around in a frame
like a football-fan's rattle. The hygrometer is then said to be ventilated.
The Hair Hygrometer

the spindle and moves a pointer over a scale, which is directly calibrated
in relative humidities. Such instruments need to be recalibrated

In 1 847 Regnault measured the volumes of various gases at pressures
of several atmospheres. Using the apparatus of Fig. 12.16, he found
that, to halve the volume of the gas, he did not have quite to double
the pressure on it. The product pV, therefore, instead of being constant,
decreased slightly with the pressure. He found one exception to this

To get high pressures, he put the apparatus at the bottom of a coal-mine,

rifle barrels, screwed together and standing up the shaft. He reached a pressure
of 3000 atmospheres.
Having found the volume-pressure

it to measure high pressures in the
laboratory, without having to resort to
the mine. His method was similar to

the open end dipping into mercury. Similarly, he trapped nitrogen in

Andrews then fitted the tubes into the copper casing C, which contained water. By turning the screws S, he forced water into the lower

were under no stress. The capillary extensions were strong enough to

Before we can interpret Andrews's results for carbon dioxide, we
must describe a simple experiment, made by Cagniard de la Tour in
1822. De la Tour made a tube of
strong glass, as shown in Fig. 12.21.
In the bulb he had water, round the
bend mercury, and at the top
where the tube was sealed off air.

He heated the tube in

was taken up by the compression of
the air, from which de la Tour
estimated the pressure; it went beyond 100 atmospheres. Above about
100°C he observed what we would
expect; that a meniscus formed in

But above
about 300°C he noticed that the
meniscus vanished that there was no observable distinction between
liquid and vapour. The temperature at which the meniscus vanished
he called the critical temperature.
If we consider the nature of a saturated vapour, the phenomenon
of the critical temperature need not surprise us. For as its temperature
rises a saturated vapour becomes denser, whereas a liquid becomes less
dense. The critical temperature is, we may suppose, the temperature
at which liquid and saturated vapour have the same density. Fig. 12.22

Behaviour of Carbon Dioxide near the Critical Point

Now let

us turn to Andrews' isothermals for carbon dioxide. These
again, this time as a simple pressure-volume diagram, in
Fig. 12.23. Let us consider the one for 21-5°C, ABCD. Andrews noticed
that, when the pressure reached the value corresponding to B, a
meniscus appeared above the mercury in the capillary containing the
carbon dioxide. He concluded that the liquid had begun to form.
From B to C, he found no change in pressure as the screws were turned,
but simply a decrease in the volume of the carbon dioxide. At the same
time the meniscus moved upwards, suggesting that the proportion of

The above account of the phenomena near the critical point is over-simple,
and may create the impression that these phenomena are fully understood. They
are not; but this is not the place to say much about the matter. We may just
point out that, even at temperature well above the critical, and when no meniscus
can be seen, considerable differences of density can be found in a so-called gas.
They have been shown by including, in a sealed tube of liquid and vapour, a
number of small glass balls of different densities. When the tube was heated
above the critical temperature, each ball floated at a point where the substance
had a density equal to that of the ball.

Gases and Vapours

A gas above its critical temperature cannot be liquefied. Early
attempts to liquefy gases such as air, by compression without cooling,
failed and the gases were wrongly called 'permanent' gases. We still,
for convenience, refer to a gas as a vapour when it is below its critical
temperature, and as a gas when it is above it. But the distinction is not
the same as that between an ideal gas and one which is far from ideal.
For a gas which is near its critical point, though it may be a little above
its critical temperature, does not obey Boyle's law, as Fig. 12.23 shows.
On the other hand, a vapour which is far from saturation obeys Boyle's

fairly well.

Refrigeration

The action of a refrigerator depends on the absorption of its latent
heat by a liquid

substance must be one whose vapour has a critical temperature above

THE EQUILIBRIUM OF SOLID, LIQUID, VAPOUR

We have pointed out that solids as well as liquids evaporate (p. 297). A solid
thus has saturated vapour over it, just as a liquid has, and the pressure of the
saturated vapour depends on the temperature. The table on p. 299 shows the
pressure of saturated water vapour over

The

Triple Point

AP relates the saturated vapour pressure of ice to its
temperature at any point on the curve, ice and water-vapour are in equilibrium.
BP is the saturated- vapour-pressure curve of water at any point on it, water
and water-vapour are in equilibrium. CP is the curve relating the melting-point
of ice with the pressure: at any point on it, ice and water are in equilibrium. The
three curves meet at the point P, whose co-ordinates are p = 4-6
mercury,
9 = 0-01 °C. These are the only conditions in which ice, water, and water-vapour
can exist together if either the temperature or pressure is altered, at least one
phase vanishes. If, when the pressure and temperature are altered, their new
values happen to lie on one of the curves, then the two corresponding phases
survive, liquid and solid along PC, for example. But if the new conditions lie in
one of the three sectors of the diagram say in PAC then the only phase
which survives is the one corresponding to that sector solid, in PAC. The point

temperature at which ice and solution can be in equilibrium. At a higher temperature, 8 2 , ice has the higher vapour pressure: it therefore sublimes faster than

are three principal ways of doing this (i) the gas may be passed through
a cold bath containing a more easily liquefied gas, which is boiling at a
reduced pressure and therefore has a very low temperature (ii) the gas

called.

These experiments suggested that in such an expansion the

gas lost no internal energy, and therefore did no work. We concluded
that the molecules of a gas had negligible attraction for one another,
since otherwise work would have had to be done against their attractions whenever the gas expanded.
In 1852, Joule and Kelvin made more delicate experiments of
essentially the same kind. They allowed a gas at high pressure to
expand into a vacuum through a plug of cotton wool (Fig. 12.28). The
plug prevented eddies from forming in the gas, so that the gas did
not acquire any kinetic energy of motion in bulk. Neither did the gas
do any external work, since it pushed back no piston. Nevertheless,
Joule and Kelvin found that the gas was cooled slightly in its passage
through the porous plug. Therefore work must have been done in
separating its molecules ; and this work must have been done at the
expense of their kinetic energy, the heat-energy of the gas.
The magnitude of the cooling in the Joule-Kelvin effect depends on
the temperature at which the gas enters the plug ; for air at room temperature it has the order of 0-1 °C per atmosphere pressure difference.
It is not essential for the gas to expand into a vacuum. Whenever a
gas expands from high pressure to low, its volume increases, and some
work is done against its inter-molecular attractions. If heat cannot

CHANGE OF STATE

work is done at the expense of the gas's internal
and the gas cools. The cooling is analogous to that which takes
place in an adiabatic expansion, but in a normal adiabatic expansion
most of the work is done externally against a piston (compare p. 251).

The Linde Process

The cooling of a gas in a free expansion is small, but Linde devised
an ingenious arrangement for making it cumulative, and so producing
a great temperature fall. His apparatus is shown diagrammatically in
Fig. 12.29. When air is to be liquefied, it must first be freed of carbon
dioxide and water, which would solidify and choke the pipes both are
removed by solid caustic soda in a vessel not shown in the figure. The
pure air is compressed to about 150 atmospheres by the pump P,
and the heat of compression is removed in the water-cooled copper
coil C. The air then passes down the copper coil D, which runs within
another copper coil E. It emerges through the nozzle
whose opening
can be adjusted from outside. The nozzle lies inside a Dewar vessel
or thermos flask F. The air expands on emerging, and is cooled by the
Joule-Kelvin effect. It then passes upwards through the outer coil E,
and as it does so, cools the incoming gas. The incoming gas is thus
cooled before making its expansion, and after its expansion becomes
cooler still. On escaping through E it cools the following gas yet
;

further. Thus the cooling of the escaping gas continuously helps the
cooling of the arriving gas, and the cooling is said to be regenerative.
Eventually the gas emerging from the nozzle cools below the critical
temperature; and since the actual pressure, 150 atmospheres, is well

The reader should appreciate that the regenerative cooling takes
place only in the double coil. At all stages in the process the air enters

the inner coil at the temperature of the cooling water around C. But
as time goes on it passes through ever-cooler gas coming up from the
nozzle, until liquid begins to form and the system reaches equilibrium.

Liquid Nitrogen and

Oxygen

As the table on p. 318 shows, the boiling-point of nitrogen, at
atmospheric pressure, is — 196°C, whereas that of oxygen is — 183°C.
When liquid air is exposed to the atmosphere, therefore, the nitrogen
boils off faster and the proportion of liquid oxygen increases. The
so-called liquid air sold commercially is mostly liquid oxygen. It is
more dangerous than true liquid air, particularly if there is hydrogen
about.

Hydrogen and Helium
At orinary temperatures, the Joule-Kelvin

effect is

reversed for

helium and hydrogen, that is, a free expansion causes warming. We
cannot go into the explanation of that here, but we may say that it is
connected with the fact that the pV/p curves of hydrogen and helium
rise with increasing pressure, instead of falling at first (Fig. 12.17,
p. 314).

These gases show a Joule-Kelvin cooling, however,

if they are
cooled before the expansion. Hydrogen must be cooled
below — 83°C and helium below — 240°C; these temperatures are
called the inversion temperatures of the gases.
Hydrogen can be cooled below its inversion temperature by passing
it through a coil in liquid air before it enters the double coil of the
liquefier. Helium must be passed through a coil in liquid hydrogen,
boiling under reduced pressure.

A barometer tube dips into a mercury reservoir and encloses a mixture of air
and saturated water vapour above the mercury column in the tube, the height
of the column being 70 cm above the level in the reservoir. If the atmospheric
pressure and the saturation pressure of water vapour are respectively 76 cm
and 1 cm of mercury, determine the height of the column when the tube is depressed in the reservoir to reduce the air volume to half its initial value. (L.)
First part. The saturation pressure of water vapour is the pressure of water
vapour in contact with water in a closed space. The dew-point is the temperature
at which the air is just saturated with the water- vapour present. The different
methods for measuring relative humidity concern the dew-point (Regnault)

Transfer of Heat

Conduction
If we put a poker into the fire, and hold on to it, then heat reaches
us along the metal. We say the heat is conducted ; and we soon find that
some substances metals are good conductors, and others such as
wood or glass are not. Good conductors feel cold to the touch on a
cold day, because they rapidly conduct away the body's heat.

Temperature Distribution along a Conductor

It how falls uniformly from hot to cold.
The difference between the temperature distributions is due to the
fact that, when the bar is unlagged, heat escapes from its sides, by
convection in the surrounding air. Thus the heat flowing past D per
second, is less than that entering the bar at A by the amount which
escapes from the surface AD. The arrows in the figure represent the
heat escaping per second from the surface of the bar, and the heat

flowing per second along its length. The heat flowing per second along
the length decreases from the hot end to the cold. But when the bar is
lagged, the heat escaping from its sides is negligible, and the flow per
second is constant along the length of the bar.
We thus see that the temperature gradient along a bar is greatest
where the heat flow through it is greatest. We also see that the temperature gradient is uniform only when there is a negligible loss of heat
from the sides of the bar.

Thermal Conductivity
Let us consider a very large thick bar, of which AB in Fig. 13.2 (i) is
a part, and along which heat is flowing steadily. We suppose that the

We can generalize this

The equation shows that, if the heat flow is uniform, the temperature
is inversely proportional to the conductivity. If the conducof dirt is 1/1000 that of copper, the temperature gradient in it is
1000 times that in copper thus 1
of dirt sets up the same temperature fall as 1
of copper. In general terms we express this result by
saying that the dirt prevents a good thermal contact, or that it provides
a bad one. The reader who has already studied electricity will se an
obvious analogy here. The flow of heat can, in fact, be treated mathematically in the same way as the flow of electricity ; we may say that a
dirt layer has a high thermal resistance, and hence causes a great
temperature drop.

eight times as good a conductor of heat. The material of the plates
makes no noticeable difference to the heat flow from the furnace outside the boiler to the water inside it, because there is always a layer of
gas between the flame and the boiler-plate. This layer may be very
thin, but its conductivity is about 1/10000 that of steel if the plate is a
centimetre thick, and the gas-film 1/1000 centimetre, then the temperature drop across the film is ten times that across the plate. Thus the
rate at which heat flows into the boiler is determined mainly by the gas.
If the water in the boiler deposits scale on the plates, the rate of heat
flow is further reduced. For scale is a bad conductor, and, though it
may not be as bad a conductor as gas, it can build up a much thicker
layer. Scale must therefore be prevented from forming, if possible
and if not, it must from time to time be removed.
Badly conducting materials are often called insulators. The importance of building dwelling-places from insulating materials hardly
needs to be pointed out. Window-glass is a ten-times better conductor
than brick, and it is also much thinner; a room with large windows
therefore requires more heating in winter than one whose walls are
more modestly pierced. Wood is as bad a conductor (or as good an
insulator) as brick, but it also is thinner. Wooden houses therefore
have double walls, with an air-space between them air is an excellent
insulator, and the walls prevent convection. In polar climates, wooden
huts must not be built with steel bolts going right through them;
otherwise the inside ends of the bolts grow icicles from the moisture

Measurement of High Conductivity: Metals

When the thermal conductivity of a metal is to be measured, two
conditions must usually be satisfied heat must flow through the
specimen at a measurable rate, and the temperature gradient along the
specimen must be measurably steep. These conditions determine the
form of the apparatus used.
When the conductor is a metal, it is easy to get a fast enough heat
flow the problem is to build up a temperature gradient. It is solved by

having as the specimen a bar long compared with its diameter. Fig. 13.4
shows the apparatus, which is due to Searle. AB is the specimen,
about 4 cm diameter and 20 cm long. In one form of apparatus it is
heated by steam at A, and cooled by circulating water at B. The whole
apparatus is heavily lagged with felt. To measure the temperature
gradient, thermometers are placed in the two mercury-filled cups C,
the cups are made of copper, and are soldered to the specimen at a
known distance apart. Alternatively, thermometers are placed in holes
bored in the bar, which are filled with mercury. In this way errors due
to bad thermal contact are avoided.
The cooling water flows in at E, round the copper coil F which is
soldered to the specimen, and out at G. The water leaving at
is
warmer than that coming in at E, so that the temperature falls continuously along the bar: if the water came in at
and out at E, it
would tend to reverse the temperature gradient at the end of the bar,
and might upset it as far back as
or C.
The whole apparatus is left running, with a steady flow of water, until
all the temperatures have become constant the temperature

Measurement of Low Conductivity: Non-metallic Solids
In measuring the conductivity of a bad conductor, the difficulty is to
an adequate heat flow. The specimen is therefore made in the form
of a thin disc, D, about 10 cm in diameter and a few millimetres thick
(Fig. 13.5 (a)). It is heated by a steam-chest C, whose bottom is thick
enough to contain a hole for a thermometer.
The specimen rests on a thick brass slab B, also containing a thermometer. The whole apparatus is hung in mid air by three strings attached

ensure good thermal contact, the adjoining faces of C,
and B
flat and clean those of C and B should be polished. A trace of
vaseline smeared over each face improves the contact.
When the temperatures have become steady, the heat passing from
C through escapes from B by radiation and convection. Its rate of
escape from B is roughly proportional to the excess temperature of B
over the room (Newton's law). Thus B takes up a steady temperature
#! such that its rate of loss of heat to the outside is just equal to its
gain through D. The rate of loss of heat from the sides of
is negligible,
because their surface area is small.
This apparatus is derived from one due to Lees, and simplified for
elementary work. If we use glass or ebonite for the specimen, the
temperature 0^ is generally about 70°C; 6 2 is, of course, about 100°C.
After these temperatures have become steady, and we have measured
them, the problem is to find the rate of heat loss from B. To do this,
we take away the specimen
and heat B directly from C until its
temperature has risen by about 10°C. We then remove C, and cover
the top part of B with a thick layer of felt F (Fig. 13.5 (b)). At intervals
of a minute
or less
we measure the temperature of B, and afterwards plot it against the time (Fig. 13.5 (c)).
While the slab B is cooling it is losing heat by radiation and convection. It is doing so under the same conditions as in the first part
of the experiment, because the felt prevents heat escaping from the
top surface. Thus when the slab B passes through the temperature 6 U
it is losing heat at the same rate as in the first part of the experiment.
The heat which it loses is now drawn from its own heat content, whereas
before it was supplied from C via
that is why the temperature of B
is now falling, whereas before it was steady. The rate at which B loses
heat at the temperature X is given by

The Cracking of Glass
Glass is a bad conductor of heat. Therefore, when a piece of glass is
heated in one place, the neighbouring parts of the glass do not at first
warm up with it. Consequently they resist the expansion of the heated
part, and the force set up cracks the glass (p. 262). To avoid cracking
the glass, care must be taken to warm the whole region around the
place to be made hot. Similarly, glass which has been heated must be
made to cool slowly and uniformly by playing the flame over it now
and then, for shorter and shorter times as it cools.

RADIATION
Radiation
All heat comes to. us, directly or indirectly, from the sun. The heat
which comes directly travels through 150 million km of space, mostly
empty, and travels in straight lines, as does the light the shade of a
tree coincides with its shadow. Both heat and light travel with the
same speed because they are cut off at the same instant in an eclipse.
Since light is propagated by waves of some kind we conclude that the
heat from the sun is propagated by similar waves, and we say it is
:

'radiated'.

As we show later, radiation is more copious from a dull black body
than from a transparent or polished one. Black bodies are also better
absorbers of radiation than polished or transparent ones, which either
allow radiation to pass through themselves, or reflect it away from
themselves. If we hold a piece of white card, with a patch of black
drawing ink on it, in front of the fire, the black patch soon comes to
feel warmer than its white surround.

can show that the foci of the mirrors are the same for heat
as for light if we replace the ball and thermometer by a lamp and
screen. (In practice we do this first, to save time in finding the foci for
the main experiment.)
To show the refraction of heat apart from the refraction of light is
more difficult. It was first done by the astronomer Herschel in 1800.
Herschel passed a beam of sunlight through a prism, as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 13.10, and explored the spectrum with a sensitive

Ultra-violet radiation is absorbed by the human skin and causes

which is necessary for the assimilation of calcium and the prevention
of rickets. It is also absorbed by green plants in them it enables water

Infra-red radiation is transmitted by quartz, and rock-salt, but most
of it is absorbed by glass. A little, that which lies near the visible red,
passes fairly easily through glass

have discovered it. When infra-red radiation falls on the skin, it gives
the sensation of warmth. It is what we usually have in mind when we
speak of heat radiation, and it is the main component of the radiation
from a hot body but it is in no essential way different from the other
components, visible and ultra-violet radiation, as we shall now see.

Wavelengths of Radiation
In books on Optics, it is shown how the wavelength of light can be
measured with a diffraction grating a series of fine close lines ruled
on glass. The wavelength ranges from 4000 x 10~ 10 m for the violet,
-10
to 7500 xlO
m for the red. The first accurate measurements of
wavelength were published in 1868 by Angstrom, and in his honour a
~ 10
distance of 10
m is called an Angstrom unit (A.U.). The wavelengths
of infra-red radiation can be measured with a grating made from fine
wires stretched between two screws of close pitch. They range from
7500 A.U. to about 1 000000 A. U. Often they are expressed in a longer
unit than the Angstrom this unit is the micron (/mi), which is 1/1000 mm.

strip of blackened platinum foil, arranged in
a compact zigzag (Fig. 13.12). On this the

resistance. When the strip is heated by the

increase is measured on the bridge. The instrument was devised by Langley in 1881 it is called a bolometer, bole

The other, commoner, type of radiation detector is called a thermopile (Nobili and Melloni, c. 1830). Its action depends on the electromotive force, which appears between the junctions of two different
metals, when one junction is
hot and the other cold. The

Older types of thermopile are made from bars of metal about a
millimetre thick. They are slow to warm up when radiation falls upon
them, but are more rugged than the modern type.
When radiation falls on the blackened discs of a thermopile, it
warms the junctions attached to them, and sets up an e.m.f. This e.m.f.
can be measured with a potentiometer, or, for less accurate work, it
can be used to deflect a galvanometer, G, connected directly to the
ends of the thermopile (Fig. 13.13).

Demonstration of reflection.

If heat is radiant energy, its intensity should fall off as the inverse
square of the distance from a point source. We can check that it does
so by setting up an electric lamp, with a compact filament, in a dark
room preferably with black walls. When we put a thermopile at different distances from the lamp, the deflection of the galvanometer is
found to be inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
If we wish to do this experiment with radiation that includes no
visible light, we must modify it. Instead of the lamp, we use a large
blackened tank of boiling water, A, and we fit the thermopile, B, with
a conical mouthpiece, blackened on the inside. The blackening prevents
any radiation from reaching the pile by reflection at the walls of the
mouthpiece. We now find that the deflection of the galvanometer, G,
does not vary with the distance of the pile from the tank, provided that
the tank occupies the whole field of view of the cone (Fig. 13.15). The area
S of the tank from which radiation can reach the thermopile is then
proportional to the square of the distance d. And since the deflection is

unchanged when the distance is altered, the total radiation from each
element of S must therefore fall off as the inverse square of the distance d.

The

Infra-red Spectrometer

Infra-red spectra are important in the study of molecular structure.

They are observed with an infra-red spectrometer, whose principle is
shown in Fig. 13.16. Since glass is opaque to the infra-red, the radiation

The

source of light is a Nernst
filament, a metal filament
coated with alkaline-earth
oxides, and heated electrically.
The radiation from such a
filament is rich in infra-red. A
carbon arc, or a gas-mantle,
may be used, however.
The slit S of the spectrometer
is at the focus of one mirror
which acts as a collimator.
After passing through the rocksalt prism, A, the radiation is

2 which replaces the telescope of an optical spectrometer. Rotating the prism
brings different wavelengths on to the slit; the position of the prism is
calibrated in wavelengths with the help of a grating.
To a fair approximation, the deflection of the galvanometer is
proportional to the radiant power carried in the narrow band of wavelengths which fall on the thermopile. If an absorbing body, such as a
solution of an organic compound, is placed between the source and the
slit, it weakens the radiation passing through the spectrometer, in
the wavelengths which it absorbs. These wavelengths are therefore
shown by a fall in the galvanometer deflection.

Radiation and Absorption

We have already pointed out that black surfaces are good absorbers
and radiators of heat, and that polished surfaces are bad absorbers
and radiators. This can be demonstrated by the apparatus in Fig. 13.18,
in which is a cubical metal tank whose sides have a variety of finishes
dull black, dull white, highly polished. It contains boiling water, and,
therefore, has a constant temperature.

with the blackened conical mouth-piece described on

p. 347.

Provided that the face of the cube occupies the whole field of view
its distance from the thermopile does not matter (p. 347).
The galvanometer deflection is greatest when the thermopile is facing
of the cone,

the dull black surface of the cube, and least when it is facing the highly
polished surface. The highly polished surface is therefore the worst
radiator of all, and the dull black is the best.
This experiment was first done by Leslie in 1804. There were no
thermopiles in those days, and Leslie detected the radiant heat with an
instrument depending on the expansion of air, which we shall not
describe. The tank with different surfaces is called Leslie's cube.
Leslie's cube can also be used in an experiment to compare the
absorbing properties of surfaces, due to Ritchie (1833). A modern
version of it is shown in Fig. 13.19. The cube C, full of boiling water, is
placed between two copper plates,
A, B, of which A is blackened and
Constanta n
B is polished. The temperature
difference between A and B is
measured by making each of them
one element in a thermo junction
they are joined by a constantan
wire, XY, and connected to a galvanometer, by copper wires, AE,
DB. If A is hotter than B, the
junction, X, is hotter than the
junction, Y, and a current flows
through the galvanometer in one
direction. If B is hotter than A, the

current

reversed.

opposite similar faces. The blackened plate, A, then becomes the hotter,
showing that it is the better absorber.
The cube is now turned so that the blackened plate, A, is opposite
the polished face of the cube, while the polished plate, B, is opposite
the blackened face of the cube. The galvanometer then shows no
deflection the plates thus reach the same temperature. It follows that
the good radiating property of the blackened face of the cube, and the
bad absorbing property of the polished plate, are just compensated
by the good absorbing property of the blackened plate, and the bad
radiating property of the polished face of the cube.

The Black Body

The experiments described before lead us to the idea of a perfectly
black body one which absorbs all the radiation that falls upon it, and
reflects and transmits none. The experiments also lead us to suppose
that such a body would be the best possible radiator.
A perfectly black body can be very nearly realized a good one can
be made in half a minute, simply by punching a small hole in the lid
of an empty tin. The hole looks almost
black, although the shining tin is a
good reflector. The hole looks black
because the light which enters through
it is reflected many times round, the
walls of the tin, before it meets the hole
again (Fig. 13.21). At each reflection,
about 80 per cent of the light energy
is reflected, and 20 per cent is absorbed.

After two reflections, 64 per cent of the

on to be reflected a third time 36 per cent has been
absorbed. After ten reflections, the fraction of the original energy which
has been absorbed is 0-8 10 or 01.
Any space which is almost wholly enclosed
approximates to a black body. And, since a
good absorber is also a good radiator, an almost
closed space is the best radiator we can find.
A form of black-body which is used in
radiation measurements is shown in Fig. 13.22.
It consists of a porcelain sphere, S, with a small
hole in it. The inside is blackened with soot
to make it as good a radiator and as bad a
reflector as possible. (The effect of multiple
Fig. 13.22. A black body.
re fl ect i on s is then to convert the body from
nearly black to very nearly black indeed.)
The sphere is surrounded by a high-temperature bath of, for example,
molten salt (the melting-point of common salt is 801 °C).
The deepest recesses of a coal or wood fire are black bodies. Anyone
who has looked into a fire knows that the deepest parts of it look
brightest
they are radiating most power. Anyone who has looked
into a fire also knows that, in the hottest part, no detail of the coals
or wood can be seen. That is to say, the radiation from an almost
enclosed space is uniform its character does not vary with the nature
of the surfaces of the space. This is so because the radiation coming
out from any area is made up partly of the radiation emitted by that
area, and partly of the radiation from other areas, reflected at the area
in question. If the surface of the area is a good radiator, it is a bad
reflector, and vice-versa. And if the hole in the body is small, the
radiations from every area inside it are well mixed by reflection before
they can escape; the intensity and quality of the radiation escaping
thus does not depend on the particular surface from which it escapes.
When we speak of the quality of radiation we mean the relative
intensities of the different wavelengths that it comprises the proportion
of red to blue, for example. The quality of the radiation from a perfectly
black body depends only on its temperature. When the body is made
hotter, its radiation becomes not only more intense, but also more
nearly white the proportion of blue to red in it increases. Because its
quality is determined only by its temperature, black-body radiation is
sometimes called 'temperature radiation'.

Lummer and Pringsheim in 1899. They used a black body represented
by B in Fig. 13.23 and measured its temperature with a thermocouple;
they took it to 2000°C. To measure the intensities of the various wavelengths, Lummer and Pringsheim used an infra-red spectrometer and

Prevost's Theory of Exchanges

In 1792 Prevost applied the idea of dynamic equilibrium to radiation.
asserted that a body radiates heat at a rate which depends only
on its surface and its temperature, and that it absorbs heat at a rate
depending on its surface and the temperature of its surroundings.
When the temperature of a body is constant, the body is losing heat
by radiation, and gaining it by absorption, at equal rates.
It is easy to think of experiments which seem to support Prevost's
theory, and the reader will certainly grasp the general idea of it if he
imagines hot pies and cold ice-creams put into the same cupboard.
But in such experiments it is difficult to get rid of the possibility of
convection. Let us rather take an old-fashioned, high vacuum, electric
lamp, and put it in a can of water (Fig. 13.25 (a)). We can find the
temperature of the lamp's filament by measuring its resistance. We
find that, whatever the temperature of the water, the filament comes
to that temperature, if we leave it long enough. When the water is
cooler than the filament, the filament cools down ; when the water is
hotter, the filament warms up.

In the abstract language of theoretical physics, Prevost's theory is
easy enough to discuss. If a hot body A (Fig. 13.25 (b)) is placed in an

evacuated enclosure B, at a lower temperature than A, then A cools
until it reaches the temperature of B. If a body C, cooler than B, is
put in B, then C warms up to the temperature of B. We conclude that
radiation from B falls on C, and therefore also on A, even though A

(Fig. 13.26 (a)). It loses heat and cools to the temperature
of D. Therefore it is radiating heat. But if C is transferred from B to
a warmer enclosure F, then C gains heat and warms up to the temperature of F (Fig. 13.26 (b)). It seems unreasonable to suppose that C
stops radiating when it is transferred to F it is more reasonable to
suppose that it goes on radiating but, while it is cooler than F, it absorbs

Let us consider a body B, in equilibrium with an enclosure A, at a
temperature T
(Fig. 13.27). If the body is perfectly black, it emits
radiation characteristics of the temperature T let us write the total
2
intensity of this radiation over all wavelengths as E watts/m
Since
the body is in equilibrium with the enclosure, it is absorbing as much
as it radiates. And since it absorbs all the radiation that falls upon it,
2
the energy falling on it per cm per second must be equal to E. This
conclusion need not surprise us, since the enclosure A is full of black
body radiation characteristic of its temperature T.

.

Now let us consider, in the same enclosure, a body C which is not black. On
each square metre of the body's surface, E watts of radiation fall (Fig. 13.27). Of
this, let us suppose that the body absorbs a fraction a, that is to say, it absorbs aE

but restricting it to a narrow band of wavelengths between A and X+5X. The

compared with the sun, or even an arc-lamp, it is cool. The experiment
consists of passing sunlight or arc-light through a spectroscope, and
observing its continuous spectrum. The sodium lamp is then placed in

can boil the water near the top in a Bunsen flame, without any discomfort. But if we hold the tube at the top, and heat it at the bottom,
then the top becomes unbearably hot long before the water boils.
The heat is brought to the top by convection ; the warm water at the
bottom expands, becomes less dense, and rises; the cold water sinks
to take its place. If we heat a beaker of water at one side, and drop in a
crystal of potassium permanganate, we can see the currents of hot
water rising, and cold descending. Central-heating systems rely on
convection to bring hot water from the boiler, in the basement, to the
so-called radiators, and to take the cooler water back to the boiler.

The radiators of a central-heating system are wrongly named; they
are con vectors. They warm the air around them, which rises, and gives
way to cooler air from cooler parts of the room. Gases are even worse

can neglect conduction through them altogether. Woollen clothes keep

Diameter of Pipes

Hot- water and steam pipes are often lagged with asbestos to reduce
the loss of heat from them. The temperature drop across the lagging
makes the outside cooler than the pipe, and so, by Newton's law, tends
to reduce the rate at which heat escapes from it. However, the lagging
increases the outside diameter of the whole, and so increases its area of
contact with the atmosphere. The increase in area tends to make
convection more vigorous, by enabling the pipe to heat a greater mass
of air. If the diameter of the pipe is small, the increase in area may more
than offset the reduction temperature of the outside, and so increase
the rate of heat loss. Thus there is a critical diameter of pipe ; if the
diameter is less than the critical value, the pipe should not be lagged.
The critical diameter depends on many factors, but is commonly of the
order of 1 cm.

The Greenhouse

A

greenhouse keeps plants warm by inhibiting convection. The
glass allows radiant heat to reach the plants from the sun, but prevents
the warm air in the greenhouse from escaping. In winter, when there is
sunshine, the heat is provided by hot water pipes. In summer the
is regulated by opening or closing the roof and windows,

The Thermometric Substance and Property

Most thermometers are of the liquid-in-glass type, because it is
simple and cheap they contain either mercury or alcohol.
The mercury and alcohol scales agree fairly well with one another,
and with either of the gas scales. The gas scales depend on the change
of volume at constant pressure and of pressure at constant volume
(p. 225). In practice the constant volume scale is always used, because
a change of pressure is easier to measure accurately than a change of
;

volume.

The mercury

scale agrees better with the gas scales than does the

366

;

alcohol scale. However, even the best mercury thermometers disagree
amongst themselves. The discrepancies may arise because the
bores of the tubes are not uniform, or the mercury is impure, or the
slightly

glass is not

homogeneous.

In most accurate work, therefore, temperatures are measured by the
changes in pressure of a gas at constant volume. At pressures of the
order of one atmosphere, different gases give slightly different temperature scales, because none of them obeys the gas laws perfectly. But as
the pressure is reduced, the gases approach closely to the ideal, and
their temperature scales come together. By observing the departure
of a gas from Boyle's law at moderate pressures it is possible to allow
for its departure from the ideal temperatures measured with the gas
in a constant volume thermometer can then be converted to the values
which would be given by the same thermometer if the gas were ideal.

known, and the temperatures at various points in it are measured with
mercury thermometers. The effect of the gas in it is then allowed for

The

International Temperature Scale

Because of the wide use of electrical thermometers, a scale of temperaon them is used throughout the laboratories of the world.
It is called the international scale of temperature, and is defined so that
temperatures expressed on it agree, within the limits of experimental
accuracy, with the same temperatures expressed on the ideal gas scale.
For the purpose of calibrating electrical thermometers, subsidiary
fixed points, in addition to the fundamental fixed points of ice and steam,
have been determined with the constant-volume gas thermometer.

Electrical

thermometers have great advantages over other types.

They are more accurate than any except gas thermometers, and are
quicker in action and less cumbersome than those.
The measuring element of a thermo-electric thermometer is the
welded junction of two fine wires. It is very small in size, and can theremeasure the temperature almost at a point. It causes very little
disturbance wherever it is placed* because the wires leading from it
are so thin that the heat loss along them is usually negligible. It has
a very small heat capacity, and can therefore follow a rapidly changing
temperature. To measure such a temperature, however, the e.m.f. of
the junction must be measured with a galvanometer, instead of a
potentiometer, and some accuracy is then lost.
The measuring element of a resistance thermometer is a spiral of finewire. It has a greater size and heat capacity than a thermojunction,
and cannot therefore measure a local or rapidly changing temperature.
But, over the range from about room temperature to a few hundred
degrees Centigrade, it is more accurate.

14.2 (a). The ends of the coil are attached to a pair of leads A, for connecting them to a Wheatstone bridge. A similar pair of leads B is near
to the leads from the coil, and connected in the adjacent arm of the
bridge (Fig. 14.2 (b)). At the end near the coil, the pair of leads B is
short-circuited. If the two pairs of leads are identical, their resistances
are equal, whatever their temperature. Thus if P = Q the dummy pair,
B, just compensates for the pair A going to the coil and the bridge
measures the resistance of the coil alone.
The platinum resistance thermometer is used to measure temperatures on the international scale between the boiling-point of oxygen
and 630°C (630°C is approximately the freezing-point of antimony,
but it is not a fixed point on the scale). The platinum used in the coil
must be of high purity. Its purity is judged by the increase in its resistance
from the ice point to the steam point. Thus if JR and R l00 are the
resistances of the coil at these points, then the coil is fit to reproduce the
international temperature scale if

At temperatures below the boiling-point of oxygen the resistance of
platinum changes rather slowly with temperature. The resistance of
lead changes more rapidly, and resistance thermometers of lead wire

have been used.
Thermocouples

Between 630°C and the gold point (10630°C) the international
temperature scale is expressed in terms of the electromotive force of a
thermocouple. The wires of the thermocouple are platinum, and
platinum-rhodium alloy (90 per cent Pt. 10 per cent Rh.). Since the
e.m.f. is to be measured on a potentiometer, care must be taken that
thermal e.m.f.'s are not set up at the junctions of the thermocouple wires
and the copper leads to the potentiometer. To do this three junctions
are made, as shown in Fig. 14.3 (a). The junctions of the copper leads to
the thermocouple wires are both placed in melting ice. The electro:

motive force of the whole system is then equal to the e.m.f. of two

where a, b and c are constants. The values of the constants are determined by measurements at the gold point (10630°C), the silver poult
(960-8°C), and the temperature of freezing antimony (about 630-3°C).
Since the freezing-point of antimony is not a fixed point on the international scale, its value in a given experiment is directly measured with
a resistance thermometer. This temperature therefore serves to link
the resistance and thermo-electric regions of the temperature scale.

Other Thermocouples
Because of their convenience, thermocouples are Used to measure
temperatures outside their range on the international scale, when the
highest accuracy is not required. The arrangement of three junctions
and potentiometer may be used, but for less accurate work the potentiometer may be replaced by a galvanometer G, in the simpler arrangement of Fig. 14.4 (a). The galvanometer scale may be calibrated to
read directly in temperatures, the known melting-points of metals like
tin and lead being used as subsidiary fixed points. For rough work,
particularly at high temperatures, the cold junction may be omitted
(Fig. 14.4 (b)). An uncertainty of a few degrees in a thousand is often of
no importance.

the wires together (Fig. 14.5 (ft)). This is true provided that the junctions of A to
C, and C to B, are both at the temperature 6. An intermediate metal, at a uniform

however, by filling the space above the liquid with nitrogen, which is
compressed as the mercury expands, and raises its boiling-point.
A mercury thermometer has a much greater heat capacity than a
thermocouple, and cannot follow a rapidly changing temperature. Also
glass, when it has been warmed and then cooled, does not immediately
contract back to its original volume at the lower temperature. If a low
temperature is measured immediately after a high one, the value given
by a mercury thermometer tends to be too low. With modern hard
glass (Jena glass) this effect is small but with a cheap thermometer the
ice point may be as much as half a degree low if taken immediately
after the steam point has been checked.
A mercury thermometer is filled by warming and dipping, as a weight
thermometer (p. 283). The mercury in its bulb is then boiled, to drive
out air. It is then allowed to cool and draw in the requisite amount of
mercury. Finally it is warmed a little above the highest temperature it is
to age. During the

ageing period the glass slowly contracts after its strong heating, and at
the end of the period the thermometer is calibrated.

Alcohol Thermometers

Ethyl alcohol boils at 78°C, and freezes at - 1 15°C. Alcohol thermometers are therefore used in polar regions. Alcohol is also used in some
of the maximum and minimum thermometers which we are about to
describe.

Maximum and Minimum Thermometers
Meteorologists observe the highest and lowest temperatures reached
by the air day and night. They use a maximum thermometer which is a
mercury thermometer containing a small glass index I (Fig. 14.8 (a)).
The thermometer is laid horizontally, in a louvred screen. When the
temperature rises the mercury pushes the index along, but when the
temperature falls the mercury leaves the index behind. The maximum
temperature is therefore shown by the end of the index nearer the
mercury. After each observation, the index is brought back to the
mercury by tilting the thermometer.

A minimum thermometer is similar to a maximum, except that it
contains alcohol instead of mercury. When the alcohol expands it
flows past the index, but when it contracts it drags the index back,
because of its surface tension (Fig. 14.8 (b)). The end of the index
nearer the meniscus therefore shows the minimum temperature. The

Bimetal Strip Thermometers
If a bimetal strip is wound into a spiral, with the more expansible
metal on the inside, then the spiral will uncoil as the temperature rises.
The movement of the spiral can be made to turn a pointer, and to act
as a thermometer. Instruments of this kind do not hold their calibration
as well as liquid-in-glass thermometers.

PYROMETERS
High temperatures are usually measured by observing the radiation
from the hot body, and the name Pyrometry is given to this measurement. Before describing pyrometers, however, we may mention some
other, rough, methods which are sometimes used. One method is to
insert in the furnace a number of ceramic cones, of slightly different
compositions; their melting-points increase from one to the next by
about 20°C. The temperature of the furnace lies between the melting-

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

376

points of adjacent cones, one of which softens and collapses, and the
other of which does not.

The temperature of steel, when

it is below red heat, can be judged by
on the thickness of the oxide film upon itTemperatures below red heat can also be estimated by the use of paints,
which change colour at known temperatures.
Radiation pyrometers can be used only above red-heat (about
600°C). They fall into two classes

is focused upon the filament F. The hot body A whose
temperature is to be found is then focused by the lens
so that its
image lies in the plane of F. The light from both the filament and the
hot body passes through a filter of red glass
before reaching the eye.
If the body is brighter than the filament, the filament appears dark on a
bright ground. If the filament is brighter than the body, it appears
bright on a dark ground. The temperature of the filament is adjusted, by
adjusting the current through it, until it merges as nearly as possible
into its background. It is then as bright as the body. The rheostat R
which adjusts the current is mounted on the body of the pyrometer,
and so is the ammeter A which measures the current. The ammeter is
calibrated directly in degrees Centigrade or Fahrenheit. A pyrometer
of this type can be adjusted to within about 5°C at 1000°C; more
elaborate types can be adjusted more closely.
The range of an optical pyrometer can be extended by introducing a
filter of green glass between the objective
and the lamp L this reduces
the brightness of the red light. A second scale on the ammeter is provided
for use when the filter is inserted.
The scale of a radiation pyrometer is calibrated by assuming that
the radiation is black-body radiation (p. 352). If as usual
the hot
body is not black, then it will be radiating less intensely than a black

with the same intensity as the actual body will be cooler than the actual

than the true temperature of the actual, not black, body. A correction
must be applied to the pyrometer reading, which depends on the
spectral emissivity of the body for red light. The wavelength X for which

Total Radiation Pyrometers

Total radiation pyrometers are less common than optical pyrometers.

As we shall see, they can only be used when the source of radiation is of
considerable size

— such as the open door of a furnace — whereas an

optical pyrometer. can be used

on a very small body such

as a lamp-

filament.

C of the tube and is shielded from
a gold-plated mirror, pierced at the centre to
allow light to reach the eye-piece, and moveable by a rack and pinion P.
In use, the eyepiece is first focused upon the disc D. The mirror
is
then adjusted until the furnace is also focused upon D. Since a body
which is black or nearly so shows no detail, focusing it upon
by
simply looking at the image would be almost impossible. To make the
focusing easier, two small plane mirrors m',
are fitted in front of D.
They are inclined with their normals at about 5° to the axis of the tube,
and are pierced with semi-circular holes to allow radiation from
to
reach the disc. The diameter of the resulting circular hole is less than
that of the disc. When the source of heat is not focused on the disc, the
two mirrors appear as at (b) in the figure when the focusing is correct,
they appear as at (c). The source must be of such a size that its image
completely fills the hole.
The radiation from the source warms the junction and sets up an
electromotive force. A galvanometer
connected to the junction is
then deflected, and can be calibrated to read directly the temperature of

the source.

The calibration gives the correct temperature if the source is a black
body. If the source is not black, its total radiation is equal to that of a
black body at some lower temperature; the pyrometer therefore reads
too low. If the total emissivity of the source is known, a correction can
be made for it. This correction is greater than it would be if an optical
pyrometer were used, that is to say, departure from perfect blackness
causes less error in an optical pyrometer than in a total radiation one.

The Foster Pyrometer
Another type of total radiation pyrometer is the Foster fixed-focus
instrument (Fig. 14.12); it also uses a thermojunction with blackened
disc. A is an open diaphragm, so placed that it and the thermojunction
are at conjugate foci of the mirror M. The thermojunction then

hot source, the amount of radiation reaching the thermocouple is
independent of the distance to the source (compare the use of a cone
with a thermopile, p. 350).
;

Comparison of Pyrometers: the International Scale
Total radiation and optical pyrometers agree within the limits of
experimental error—1° at 1750°C, about 4° at 2800°C. The choice
between them is decided solely by convenience. The international
temperature scale above the gold-point (1063-0°C) is defined in terms
of an optical pyrometer.

A sectored disc can be used to extend the range of an optical pyrometer, but the calculation is more difficult than for a total radiation

Introduction

If you wear spectacles you will appreciate particularly that the science
of Light, or Optics as it is often called, has benefited people all over the
world. The illumination engineer has developed the branch of Light
dealing with light energy, and has shown how to obtain suitable lighting
conditions in the home and the factory, which is an important factor in
maintaining our health. Microscopes, used by medical research workers
in their fight against disease; telescopes, used by seamen and astronomers; and a variety oh optical instruments which incorporate lenses,
mirrors, or glass prisms, such as cameras, driving mirrors, and binoculars,
all testify to the scientist's service to the community.
In mentioning the technical achievements in Light, however, it must
not be forgotten that the science of Light evolved gradually over the
past centuries; and that the technical advances were developed from the
experiments and theory on the fundamental principles of the subject
made by scientists such as Newton, Huygens, and Fresnel.

Light Travels in Straight Lines. Eclipses and Shadows

When sunlight is streaming through an open window into a room,
observation shows that the edges of the beam of light, where the shadow
begins, are straight. This suggests that light travels in straight lines, and
on this assumption the sharpness of shadows and the formation of
eclipses

can be explained. Fig.

our natural source of light, when the moon, M, passes between the sun
and the earth, E. The moon is a non-luminous object which does not
allow light to pass through it, and hence the boundaries of the shadows
formed by
on the earth are obtained by drawing lines from S which

touch the edge of M. Consequently there is a total eclipse of the sun at

is a form of energy. We know this is the case because plants and
vegetables grow when they absorb sunlight. Further, electrons are ejected
from certain metals when light is incident on them, showing that there
was some energy in the light; this phenomenon is the basis of the
photoelectric cell (p. 1077). Substances like wood or brick which allow
no light to pass through them are called "opaque" substances; unless

emits a divergent beam of light; while a source of light behind a lens, as
in a projection lantern, can provide a convergent beam, Fig. 15.2 (ii), (iii).

The Velocity of Light

The velocity of light is constant for a given medium, such as air, water,
or -glass, and has its greatest magnitude, about 3-0 x 10 8 metres per
second, in a Vacuum. The velocity of light in air differs only slightly
from its velocity in a vacuum, so that the velocity in air is also about
3-0 x 10 8 metres per second. The velocity of light in glass is about
2-0 x 10 8 metres per second; in water it is about 2-3 x 10 8 metres per
second. On account of the difference in velocity in air and glass, light
changes its direction on entering glass from air (see Refraction, p. 679).
Experiments to determine the velocity of light are discussed later, p. 551

The ciliary muscles, C, enable the eye to

see clearly objects at different

distances, a property of the eye known as its "power of accommodation".
The ciliary muscles are attached to the lens L, and when they contract,

the lens' surfaces are pulled out so that they bulge more; in this way
a near object can be focused clearly on the retina and thus seen distinctly.
When a very distant object is observed the ciliary muscles are relaxed,

and the lens' surfaces are flattened.
The use of two eyes gives a three-dimensional aspect of the object or
scene observed, as two slightly different views are imposed on the
retinae; this gives a sense of distance not enjoyed by a one-eyed person.

Regular and Diffuse Reflection
In the case of a plane mirror or glass surface, it follows from the laws
of reflection that a ray incident at a given angle on the surface is reflected
in a definite direction. Thus a parallel beam of light incident on a plane
is reflected as a parallel beam in the direction

Suppose that the angle of elevation of the sun, S, is required. Looking
through T, the mirror O is turned until the view H' of the horizon seen
directly through the unsilvered half of B, and also the view of it, H, seen
by successive reflection at O and the silvered half of B, are coincident.
The mirror O is then parallel to B in the position lt and the ray HO
is reflected along OB and BD to enter the telescope T. The mirror
O is now rotated to a position 2 until the image of the sun S, seen by
successive reflections at O and B, is on the horizon H', and the angle
of rotation, 0, of the mirror is noted, Fig. 16.6.
The ray SO from the sun is now reflected in turn from O and B so
that it travels along BD, the direction of the horizon, and the angle of
deviation of the ray is thus angle SOH. But the angle between the

Since the angle of deviation after two successive reflections is independent of the angle of incidence on the first mirror (p. 394), the image
of the sun S through T will continue to be seen on the horizon once O
is adjusted, no matter how the ship pitches or rolls. This is an advantage

Images in Plane Mirrors

So far we have discussed the deviation of light by a plane mirror. We

such a way that angle

phenomenon can be explained by considering an E-shaped object placed
in front of a mirror M, Fig. 16.8. The image of a point a on the object
is at a' at an equal distance behind the mirror, and the image of a point
b on the left of a is at b', which is on the right of a'. The left-hand side
of the image thus corresponds to the right-hand side of the object, and
vice-versa, and the object is said to be perverted, or laterally inverted
to

an observer.

Virtual and Real Images

As was shown on p. 396, an object O in front of a mirror has an image
behind the mirror. The rays reflected from the mirror do not actually
pass through I, but only appear to do so, and the image cannot be
received on a screen because the image is behind the mirror, Fig. 16.9
(i). This type of image is therefore called an unreal or virtual image.

It must not be thought, however, that only virtual images are obtained
with a plane mirror. If a convergent beam is incident on a plane mirror
M, the reflected rays pass through a point I in front o/M, Fig. 16.9 (ii).
If the incident beam converges to the point O, the latter is termed a
"virtual" object; I is called a real image because it can be received on a

image and object are at equal distances from the mirror.

Location of Images by

A virtual image can be located by the method of no parallax, which we

a virtual image I behind M, Fig. 16.10. A pin P behind the mirror is then

hence P is at the place of the image I, which is thus located. When
P and I do not coincide, they appear to move relative to one another
when the observer's head is moved; this relative movement is called
"parallax". It is useful to note that the nearer object moves in the
latter

opposite direction to the observer.
The method of no parallax can be used, as we shall see later, to locate
the positions of real images, as well as virtual images, obtained with
lenses

Reflection at curved mirrors

Curved mirrors are reputed to have been used thousands of years ago.
Today motor-cars and other vehicles are equipped with

which are curved, searchlights have curved mirrors inside them, and
the largest telescope in the world utilises a huge curved mirror (p. 544).

Convex and Concave Mirrors.

Definitions

In the theory of Light we are mainly concerned with curved mirrors
which are parts of spherical surfaces. In Fig. 17.1 {a), the mirror APB is
part of a sphere whose centre C is in front of the reflecting surface; in
Fig. 17. 1 (b), the mirror KPL is part of a sphere whose centre C is behind

The mid-point, P, of the mirror is called its pole; C, the centre of the

and AB is called the aperture of the mirror. The line PC is known as the

the mirrors; lines parallel to PC are called secondary axes.

(ii)

Fig. 17.2. Foci of concave and convex mirrors.

If a narrow beam of parallel rays is incident on a convex mirror,
experiment shows that the reflected rays form a divergent beam which
appear to come from a point F behind the mirror, Fig. 17.2 (ii). A convex
mirror has thus a virtual focus, and the image of the sun cannot be
received on a screen using this type of mirror. To express its action
on & parallel beam of light, a convex mirror is often called a "diverging"

mirror.

When a wide beam of light, parallel to
the principal axis, is incident on a concave spherical mirror, experiment shows
that reflected rays do not pass through
a single point, as was the case with a
narrow beam. The reflected rays appear
to touch a surface known as a caustic
surface, S, which has an apex, or cusp,
at F, the principal focus, Fig. 17.3. Similarly, if a wide beam of parallel light is
incident on a convex mirror, the reflected
rays do not appear to diverge from a
single point, as was the case with a

Parabolic Mirrors
If a small lamp is placed at the focus, F, of a concave mirror, it
follows from the principle of the reversibility of light (p. 390) that rays

round a small area about the pole are reflected
(i). But those rays from the lamp which strike the
mirror at points well away from P will be reflected in different directions,
because a wide parallel beam is not brought to a focus at F, as shown
in Fig. 17.3. The beam of light reflected from the mirror thus diminishes

From now onwards we shall be concerned with curved spherical

The distance PC from the pole to the centre of curvature is known as
the radius of curvature (r) of a mirror; the distance PF from the pole
to the focus is known as the focal length (f) of the mirror. As we shall

Images in Concave Mirrors

Concave mirrors produce images of different sizes; sometimes they
and real, and on other occasions they are erect (the same
way up as the object) and virtual. As we shall see, the nature of the
image formed depends on the distance of the object from the mirror.
Consider an object of finite size OH placed at O perpendicular to the
principal axis of the mirror, Fig. 17.6 (i). The image, R, of the top point
are inverted

can be located by the intersection of two reflected rays coming
from H, and the rays usually chosen are two of the following:
(1) The ray HT parallel to the principal axis, which is reflected to pass
through the focus, F, (2) the ray HC passing through the centre of
curvature, C, which is reflected back along its own path because it is a
normal to the mirror, (3) the ray HF passing through the focus, F,
which is reflected parallel to the principal axis. Since the mirror has a
small aperture, and we are considering a narrow beam of light, the
mirror must be represented in accurate image drawings by a straight
line. Thus PT in Fig. 17.6 (i) represents a perfect mirror.
When the object is a very long distance away (at infinity), the image
is small and is formed inverted at the focus (p. 402). As the object
approaches the centre of curvature, C, the image remains real and

Thus in addition to providing an erect image the convex mirror has a

Formula for Mirrors. Sign Convention

Many

of the advances in the uses of curved mirrors and lenses have
from the use of optical formula ,and we have now to consider
the relation which holds between the object and image distances in
mirrors and their focal length. In order to obtain a formula which holds
for both concave and convex mirrors, a sign rule or convention must be
obeyed, and we shall adopt the following:
resulted

A real object or image distance is a positive distance.
A virtual object or image distance is a negative distance.
In brief, "real is positive, virtual is negative". The focal length of a
concave mirror is thus a positive distance; the focal length of a convex
mirror is a negative distance.

Concave Mirror
Consider a point object O on the principal axis of a concave mirror.
ray
from O is reflected in the direction XI making an equal
angle 6 with the normal CX; a ray OP from O, incident at P, is reflected
back along PO, since CP is the normal at P. The point of intersection,
I, of the two rays is the image of O. Fig. 17.9.

Convex Mirror

Method 1. By using a convex lens, L, a real image of an object O can
be formed at a point C on the other side of L, Fig. 17.15. The convex
mirror, MN, is then placed between L and C with its reflecting face
facing the lens, so that a convergent beam of rays is incident on the
mirror. When the latter is moved along the axis OC a position will be
reached when the beam is incident normally on the mirror, in which
case the rays are reflected back along the incident path. A real inverted
image is then formed at O.

Fig. 17.15. Convex mirror measurement.

N

Since the rays incident on the mirror, for example at
or M, are
normal to the mirror surface, they will, if produced, pass through the
centre of curvature, C, of the mirror. Thus the distance PC
r, the
radius of curvature. Since PC
LC — LP, this distance can be obtained
from measurement of LP and LC, the latter being the image distance
from the lens when the mirror is taken away.
Method 2. A more difficult method than the above consists of
positioning a pin O in front of the convex mirror, when a virtual image,
I, is formed, Fig. 17.16. A small plane mirror
is then moved between
O and P until the image I' of the lower part of O in coincides in
position with the upper part of the image of O in the convex mirror.
The distances OP, MP are then measured.

EXAMPLES
1. Show that a concave spherical mirror can produce a focused image of
an object when certain conditions are observed, and prove the usual relation
between the object and image distances. A linear object, 10 cm long, lies
along the axis of a concave mirror whose radius of curvature is 30 cm, the
near end of the object lying 18 cm from the mirror. Find the magnification

of the image. (W.)

The condition for a focused image is that the light from the
must be incident as a narrow beam round the pole of the mirror. This
implies that the object must be small (p. 402). The usual relation between the
object and image distances is proved on p. 407.

Drawing the Refracted Ray by Geometrical Construction
Since sin //sin r = n, the direction of the refracted ray can be calculated
when a ray is incident in air at a known angle i on a medium of given
refractive index n. The direction of the refracted ray can also be obtained
by means of a geometrical construction. Thus suppose AO is a ray
incident in air at a given angle / on a medium of refractive index n,
Fig. 18.6 (i). With O as centre, two circles, a, b, are drawn whose radii
are in the ratio 1 n, and AO is produced to cut circle a at P. PN is then
drawn parallel to the normal at O to intersect circle b at Q. OQ is then
the direction of the refracted ray.

Total Internal Reflection. Critical Angle
If a ray AO in glass is incident at a small angle a on a glass-air
plane
boundary, observation shows that part of the incident light is reflected
along OE in the glass, while the remainder of the light is refracted away

from the normal

at an angle jS into the air. The reflected ray OE is
weak, but the refracted ray OL is bright, Fig. 18.12 (i). This means that
most of the incident light energy is transmitted, and a little is reflected.
When the angle of incidence, o, in the glass is increased, the angle of
emergence, j9, is increased at the same time; and at some angle of incidence c in the glass the refracted ray OL travels along the glass-air
boundary, making the angle of refraction of 90°, Fig. 18.12 (ii). The reflected ray OE is still weak in intensity, but as the angle of incidence in
the glass is increased slightly the reflected ray suddenly becomes bright,

and no refracted ray

3. Total reflection of radio waves.
radio wave is an example of an
electromagnetic wave because it comprises electric and magnetic forces.
Light waves also are electromagnetic waves (p. 983). Light waves and
radio waves are therefore the same in nature, and a close analogy can
be made between the refraction of light and the refraction of a radio
wave when the latter enters a medium containing electric particles.

In particular, the phenomenon of total reflection occurs when radio
waves travel from one place, S, on the earth, for example England, to
another place, R, on the other side of the earth, for example America,
Fig. 18.14 (ii). A layer of considerable density of electrons exists many

miles above the earth (at night this is the Appleton layer), and when a
radio wave SA from a transmitter is sent skyward it is refracted away

from the normal on entering the electron layer. At some height, corresponding to O, a critical angle is reached, and the wave then begins to
be refracted downward. After emerging from the electron layer it returns
to R on the earth, where its presence can be detected by a radio receiver.

contain a thin film of air of constant thickness between them, thus
forming an air-cell, X. The liquid whose refractive index is required is
placed in a glass vessel V having thin plane-parallel sides, and
is placed
in the liquid. A bright source of light, S,. provides rays which are incident on one side of
in a constant direction SO, and the light through
is observed by a person on the other side at E.
When the light is incident normally on the sides of X, the light passes

is rotated farther, the light is suddenly
cut off from E, and hence no light now passes through X, Fig. 18.15 (i).
Fig. 18.15 (ii) illustrates the behaviour of the light when this happens.
The ray SO is refracted along OB in the glass, but at B total internal
reflection begins. Suppose ix is the angle of incidence in the liquid, i,

so that it could be swung away from Y. A drop of the liquid is placed on
the surface a, which is matt, and the prisms are placed together so that the
liquid is squeezed into a thin film between them. Light from a suitable source
is directed towards the prisms by means of a mirror M, where it strikes the
surface a and is scattered by the matt surface into the liquid film. The emergent
rays are collected in a telescope T directed towards the prisms, and the field
of view is divided into a dark and bright portion. The table A is then turned
until the dividing line between the dark and bright fields is on the crosswires
of the telescope, which is fixed. The reading on the scale S, which is attached

The Spectrometer

The spectrometer is an optical instrument which is mainly used to
study the light from different sources. As we shall see later, it can be
used to measure accurately the refractive index of glass in the form of a
prism. The instrument consists essentially of a collimator, C, a telescope,
T, and a table, R, on which a prism B can be placed. The lenses in C, T
are achromatic lenses (p. 515). The collimator is fixed, but the table
and the telescope can be rotated round a circular scale graduated in
half-degrees (not shown) which has a common vertical axis with the
table, Fig. 19.6.
vernier is also provided for this scale. The source of
light, S, used in the experiment is placed in front of a narrow slit at one
end of the collimator, so that the prism is illuminated by light from S.

A

REFRACTION THROUGH PRISMS

445

R
Fig. 19.6. Spectrometer.

Before the spectrometer can be used, however, three adjustments
must be made: (1) The collimator C must be adjusted so that parallel
light emerges from it; (2) the telescope T must be adjusted so that
parallel rays entering

it

are brought to a focus at cross-wires near

its

eye-piece; (3) the refracting edge of the prism must be parallel to the
axis of rotation of the telescope, i.e., the table must be "levelled".

Adjustments of Spectrometer

The telescope adjustment is made by first moving its eye-piece until
the cross-wires are distinctly seen, and then sighting the telescope on to
a distant object through an open window. The length of the telescope is

now

altered by a screw arrangement until the object is clearly seen at
same place as the cross-wires, so that parallel rays now entering
the telescope are brought to a focus at the cross-wires.
The collimator adjustment. With the prism removed from the table,
the telescope is now turned to face the collimator, C, and the slit in C is
illuminated by a sodium flame which provides yellow light. The edges
of the slit are usually blurred, showing that the light emerging from the
lens of C is not a parallel beam. The position of the slit is now adjusted
by moving the tube in C, to which the slit is attached, until the edges of

the

the latter are sharp.
"Levelling" the table. If the rectangular slit is not in the centre of the
field of view when the prism is placed on the table, the refracting edge of
the prism is not parallel to the axis of rotation of the telescope. The

must then be adjusted, or "levelled", by means of the screws a,
beneath it. One method of procedure consists of placing the prism
on the table with one face
approximately perpendicular to the line
joining two screws a, b, as shown in Fig. 19.6. The table is turned until
is illuminated by the light from C, and the telescope T is then moved
to receive the light reflected from MN. The screw b is then adjusted

away from the collimator, as shown in Fig. 19.8 (i). The telescope is then
turned until an image of the slit is obtained on the cross-wires, corresponding to the position Tv The table is now slowly rotated so that the
angle of incidence on the left side of the prism decreases, and the image

Total Reflecting Prisms

When a plane mirror silvered on the back is used as a reflector,
multiple images are obtained (p. 424). This disadvantage is overcome
by
using right-angled isosceles prisms as reflectors of light in optical
instruments such as submarine periscopes (see p. 540).
Consider a ray

from the prism along RT, and since the angle of reflection at P is equal
to the incident angle, RT is perpendicular to OQ. The prism thus deviates
the light through 90°. If the prism is positioned as shown in Fig. 19.11
(ii), an inverted bright virtual image I of the object O is seen by total
reflection at the two surfaces of the prism.
There is no loss of brightness when total internal reflection occurs at a
surface, whereas the loss may be as much as 10 per cent or more in
reflection at a silver surface.

Spectrum of White Light

In 1666,

Newton made a

great scientific discovery. He found that

sunlight, or white light,

Newton made a small
hole in a shutter in a darkened room, and received a white circular patch
of sunlight on a screen S in the path of the light, Fig. 20.1 (i). But on
interposing a glass prism between the hole and the screen he observed

of the coloured images being several times their width,
Fig. 20.1 (ii). By separating one colour from the rest, Newton demonstrated that the colours themselves could not be changed by refraction
through a prism, and he concluded that the colours were not introduced
by the prism, but were components of the white light. The spectrum

and violet, and the separaion of the colours by the prism is known as

DISPERSION. SPECTRA
Production of Pure Spectrum

Newton's spectrum of sunlight is an impure spectrum because the
images overlap, Fig. 20.1 (ii). A pure spectrum is one
in which the different coloured images contain light of one colour only,
i.e., they are monochromatic images. In order to obtain a pure spectrum
(i) the white light must be admitted through a very narrow opening, so
as to assist in the reduction of the overlapping of the images, (ii) the
beams of coloured rays emerging from the prism must be parallel, so
that each beam can be brought to a separate focus.
The spectrometer can be used to provide a pure spectrum. The
collimator slit is made very narrow, and the collimator C and the
telescope T are both adjusted for parallel light, Fig. 20.2. A bright source

essential. The rays refracted through P are now separated into a number

of white

of different coloured parallel beams of light, each travelling in slightly
and the telescope brings each coloured beam to a
separate focus. A pure spectrum can now be seen through T, consisting
of a series of monochromatic images of the slit.
If only one lens, L, is available, the prism P must be placed in the
minimum deviation position for yellow light in order to obtain a fairly
pure spectrum, Fig. 20.3. The prism is then also approximately in the

phototransistor, such as Mullard OCP71, connected to an amplifier and galvanometer is very sensitive to infra-red light. When this detector is
moved into the dark part beyond the red end of the spectrum, a deflection is
obtained in the galvanometer. Since they are not scattered by fine particles
as much as the rays in the visible spectrum, infra-red rays can penetrate fog
and mist. Clear pictures have been taken in mist by using infra-red filters and
photographic plates.
About 1801 Ritter discovered the existence of invisible rays beyond the
violet end of the visible spectra. Ultra-violet rays, as they are known, affect
photographic plates and cause certain minerals to fluoresce. They can also
eject electrons from metal plates (see Photoelectric effect, p. 1077). Ultraviolet rays can be detected in the laboratory by using an arc light in the place
of S in Fig. 20.3, a quartz lens at L, and a quartz prism at P. A sensitive detector
is a photoelectric cell connected to a galvanometer and battery. When the cell
is moved beyond the violet into the dark part of the spectrum a deflection is
observed in the galvanometer.

Dispersion by Small-angle Prism

We

have already seen from Newton's experiment that the colours
are separated by a glass prism into red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, so that the emergent light is no
longer white but coloured. The separation of the colours by the prism
is known generally as the phenomenon of dispersion, and the angular
dispersion between the red and blue emergent rays, for example, is
defined as the angle between these two rays. Thus, in Fig. 20.5,
is the
angular dispersion between the red and blue rays. Of course, the angular
dispersion is also equal to the difference in deviation of the two colours
produced by the prism; and since we have already derived the
expression d
(n - 1) A for the deviation of monochromatic light by
a small-angle prism we can obtain the angular dispersion between any

Achromatic Prisms

We have seen that a prism separates the colours in white light. If a
prism is required to deviate white light without dispersing it into colours,
two prisms of different material must be used to eliminate the dispersion,
as shown in Fig. 20.6. The prism P is made of crown glass, and causes
dispersion between the red and blue in the incident white light. The
prism Q is inverted with respect to P, and with a suitable choice of its
angle A' (discussed fully later), the red and blue rays incident on it can
be made to emerge in parallel directions. If the rays are viewed the eyelens brings them to a focus at the same place on the retina, and hence

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

the colour effect due to red and blue rays is eliminated. The dispersion
of the other colours in white light still remains, but most of the colour
effect is eliminated as the red and blue rays are the "outside" (extreme)
rays in the spectrum of white light.

Now prism P produces its dispersion in a "downward" direction since

Deviation Produced by Achromatic Prisms

Although the colour effects between the red and blue rays are
eliminated by the use of achromatic prisms, it should be carefully
noted that the incident light beam, as a whole, has been deviated.
This angle of deviation, d, is shown in Fig. 20.6, and is the angle between
the incident and emergent beams. The deviation of the mean or yellow

Direct-vision Spectroscope

The direct-vision spectroscope is a simple instrument used for examining the different colours in the spectrum obtained from a glowing gas
in a flame or in a discharge tube. It contains several crown and flint
prisms cemented together, and contained in a straight tube having
lenses which constitute an eye-piece. The tube is pointed at the source
of light examined, when various colours are seen on account of the
dispersion produced

by the prisms,

Fig. 20.7.

In practice, the direct-vision spectroscope contains several crown
and flint glass prisms, but for convenience suppose we consider two
such prisms, as in Fig. 20.7. For "direct vision", the net deviation of the
mean (yellow) ray produced by the prisms must be zero. Thus the
mean deviation caused by the crown glass prism in one direction must
be equal to that caused by the flint glass prism in the opposite direction.
Hence, with the notation already used, we must have

SPECTRA
The Importance of the Study of Spectra

The study of the wavelengths of the radiation from a hot body comes
under the general heading of Spectra. The number of spectra of elements
and compounds which have been recorded runs easily into millions, and
it is worth while stating at the outset the main reasons for the interest
in the phenomenon.
It is now considered that an atom consists of a nucleus of positive
electricity surrounded by electrons moving in various orbits, and that
a particular electron in an orbit has a definite amount of energy. In
certain circumstances the electron

may jump from this orbit to

another,

has a smaller amount of energy. When this occurs radiation
is emitted, and the energy in the radiation is equal to the difference in
energy of the atom between its initial and final states. The displacement
of an electron from one orbit to another occurs when a substance is
raised to a high temperature, in which case the atoms present collide
with each other very violently. Light of a definite wavelength will then
be emitted, and will be characteristic of the electron energy changes in
the atom. There is usually more than one wavelength in the light from a
hot body (iron has more than 4,000 different wavelengths in its spectrum),
and each wavelength corresponds to a change in energy between two
orbits.
study of spectra should therefore reveal much important
information concerning the structure and properties of atoms.
Every element has a unique spectrum. Consequently a study of the
spectrum of a substance enables its composition to be readily determined. Spectroscopy is the name given to the exact analysis of mixtures
or compounds by a study of their spectra, and the science has developed
to such an extent that the presence in a substance of less than a millionth
of a milligram of sodium can be detected.

A

Types of emission spectra. There are three different types of spectra, which
are easily recognised. They are known as (a) line spectra, (b) band spectra,
(c) continuous spectra.
(a) Line spectra. When the light emitted by the atoms of a glowing substance
(such as vaporised sodium or helium gas) is examined by a prism and spectrometer, lines of various wavelengths are obtained. These lines, it should be
noted, are images of the narrow slit of the spectrometer on which the light
is incident. The spectra of hydrogen, Fig. 20.8, and helium are line spectra, and
it is generally true that line spectra are obtained from atoms.

(6) Band spectra. Band spectra are obtained from molecules, and consist
of a series of bands each sharp at one end but "fading" at the other end, Fig.

DISPERSION. SPECTRA

463

Hie term "fluting" is often used to describe the way in which the bands
are spaced. Careful examination reveals that the bands are made up of
numerous fine lines very close to each other. Two examples of band spectra
are those usually obtained from nitrogen and oxygen.

20.9.

Fig. 20.9. Diagrammatic representation of band spectra.

(c) Continuous spectra. The spectrum of the sun is an example of a continuous spectrum, and, in general, the latter are obtained from solids and
liquids. In these states of matter the atoms and molecules are close together,

and electron orbital changes in a particular atom are influenced by neighbouring atoms to such an extent that radiations of all different wavelengths
are emitted. In a gas the atoms are comparatively far apart, and each atom
is uninfluenced by any other. The gas therefore emits radiations of wavelengths which result from orbital changes in the atom due solely to the high
temperature of the gas, and a line spectrum is obtained. When the temperature
of a gas is decreased and pressure applied so that the liquid state is approached,
the line spectrum of the gas is observed to broaden out considerably.
Production of spectra. In order to produce its spectrum the substance under
examination must be heated to a high temperature. There are four main
methods of excitation, as the process is called, and spectra are classified under
the method of their production.
(a) Flame spectra. The temperature of a Bunsen flame is high enough to
vaporise certain solids. Thus if a piece of platinum wire is dipped into a
sodium salt and then placed in the flame, a vivid yellow colour is obtained
which is characteristic of the element sodium. This method of excitation can
only be used for a limited number of metals, the main class being the alkali
and alkaline earth metals such as sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, and
barium. The line spectra produced in each case consist of lines of different
colours, but some lines have a greater intensity than others. Thus sodium is
characterised by two prominent yellow lines barely distinguishable in a small
spectroscope, and lithium by a prominent green line.
(6) Spark spectra. If metal electrodes are connected to the secondary of
an induction coil and placed a few millimetres apart, a spark can be obtained
which bridges the gap. It was discovered that a much more intense and violent
spark could be obtained by placing a capacitor in parallel with the gap. This
spark is known as a condensed spark. The solid under investigation forms one
of the electrodes, and is vaporised at the high temperature obtained.
(c) Arc spectra. This is the method most used in industry. If two metal rods
connected to a d.c. voltage supply are placed in contact with each other and
then drawn a few millimetres apart, a continuous spark, known as an arc,
is obtained across the gap. The arc is a source of very high temperature,
and
therefore vaporises substances very readily. In practice the two rods are placed
in a vertical position, and a small amount of the substance investigated is
placed on the lower rod.
(d) Discharge-tube spectra. If a gas is contained at low pressure inside a
tube having two aluminium electrodes and a high a.c. or d.c. voltage is
applied to the gas, a "discharge" occurs between the electrodes and the gas

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

becomes luminous. This is the most convenient method of examining the
spectra of gases. The luminous neon gas in a discharge tube has a reddish
colour, while mercury vapour is greenish-blue.

Absorption Spectra. Kirchhoff's

The

Law

spectra just discussed are classified as emission spectra. There is
known as absorption spectra, which we shall

another class of spectra

now briefly consider.
If light

from a source having a continuous spectrum

is

examined

has passed through a sodium flame, the spectrum is found to be
crossed by a dark line; this dark line is in the position corresponding to
the bright line emission spectrum obtained with the sodium flame alone.
The continuous spectrum with the dark line is naturally characteristic
of the absorbing substance, in this case sodium, and it is known as an
absorption spectrum. An absorption spectrum is obtained when red
glass is placed in front of sunlight, as it allows only a narrow band of
red rays to be transmitted.
Kirchhoff's investigations on absorption spectra in 1855 led him
to formulate a simple law concerning the emission and absorption of
light by a substance. This states A substance which emits light ofa certain
wavelength at a given temperature can also absorb light of the same
wavelength at that temperature. In other words, a good emitter of a certain
wavelength is also a good absorber of that wavelength. From Kirchhoff's law it follows that if the radiation from a hot source emitting a
continuous spectrum is passed through a vapour, the absorption
spectrum obtained is deficient in those wavelengths which the vapour
would emit if it were raised to the same high temperature. Thus if a
sodium flame is observed through a spectrometer in a darkened room,
a bright yellow line is seen; if a strong white arc light, richer in yellow
light than the sodium flame, is placed behind the flame, a dark line is
observed in the place of the yellow line. The sodium absorbs yellow light
from the white light, and re-radiates it in all directions. Consequently
there is less yellow light in front of the sodium flame than if it were
removed, and a dark line is thus observed.

:

Fraunhofer Lines

In 1814 Fraunhofer noticed that the sun's spectrum was crossed
by many hundreds of dark lines. These Fraunhofer lines, as they are
called, were mapped out by him on a chart of wavelengths, and the more
prominent were labelled by the letters of the alphabet. Thus the dark
line in the blue part of the spectrum was known as the Fline, the dark
line in the yellow part as the D line, and the dark line in the red part as
the

C line.

The Fraunhofer

lines indicate the presence in the sun's atmosphere
of certain elements in a vaporised form. The vapours are cooler than
the central hot portion of the sun, and they absorb their own characteristic wavelengths from the sun's continuous spectrum. Now every element

DISPERSION. SPECTRA

465

has a characteristic spectrum of wavelengths. Accordingly, it became
possible to identify the elements round the sun from a study of the
wavelengths of the Fraunhofer (dark) lines in the sun's spectrum, and
it was then found that hydrogen and helium were present. This was how
helium was first discovered. The
line is the yellow sodium line.
The incandescent gases round the sun can be seen as flames many

D

miles high during a total eclipse of the sun, when the central portion of
the sun is cut off from the observer. If the spectrum of the sun is observed

an

eclipse takes place, a continuous spectrum with Fraunobtained, as already stated. At the instant when the eclipse
becomes total, however, bright emission lines are seen in exactly the
same position as those previously occupied by the Fraunhofer lines, and
they correspond to the emission spectra of the vapours alone. This is
an illustration of Kirchhoff 's law, p. 464.

Measurement of Wavelengths by Spectrometer

As we shall discuss later (p. 690) the light waves produced by different
colours are characterised by different wavelengths. Besides measuring
refractive index, the spectrometer can be adapted for measuring unknown wavelengths, corresponding to the lines in the spectrum of a
glowing gas in a discharge tube, for example.

A

prism is first placed on the spectrometer table in the minimum
deviation position for yellow (sodium) light, thus providing a reference
position for the prism in relation to incident light from the collimator.

The source of yellow

light is now replaced by a helium discharge tube,
which contains helium at a very low pressure, glowing as a result of the
high voltage placed across the tube. Several bright lines of various
colours can now be observed through the telescope (they are differently
coloured images of the slit), and the deviation, 9, of each of the lines is
obtained by rotating the telescope until the image is on the cross-wires,

and then noting the corresponding
reading on the circular graduated
scale. Since the wavelengths, A,

spectrum are known very accur-

Refraction through lenses

A

lens is

a piece of glass bounded by one or two spherical surfaces.

When a lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges it is called a convex
or converging lens, Fig. 21.1 (i); when it is thinner in the middle than at
the edges it is known as a concave or diverging lens, Fig. 21.1 (ii). Fig. 21 .9,
on p. 478, illustrates other types of converging and diverging lenses.
Lenses were no doubt

made soon

after

the art of glass-making was discovered;
and as the sun's rays could be concentrated by these curved pieces of glass
they were called "burning glasses".
Aristophanes, in 424 B.C., mentions a
burning glass. To-day, lenses are used

Since a lens has a curved spherical surface, a thorough study of a
lens should be preceded by a discussion of the refraction of light through
a curved surface. We shall therefore proceed to consider what happens
in this case, and defer a discussion of lenses until later, p. 478.

REFRACTION AT CURVED SPHERICAL SURFACE
Relation Between Object and Image Distances

Consider a curved spherical surface NP, bounding media of refractive
indices n lt n 2 respectively, Fig. 21.2. The medium of refractive index n x
might be air, for example, and the other of refractive index n 2 might be
glass. The centre, C, of the sphere of which NP is part is the centre of
curvature of the surface, and hence CP is the radius of curvature, r.
The line joining C to the mid-point P of the surface is known as its
principal axis.

P is known as the pole.

Suppose a point object O is situated on the axis PC in the medium of
refractive index n x The image of O by refraction at the curved surface
can be obtained by taking two rays from O. A ray OP passes straight
through along PC into the medium of refractive index n 2 , since OP is
normal to the surface, while a ray ON very close to the axis is refracted

The quantity (» 2 — n^/r is known as the power of the surface. If a ray is
made to converge by a surface, as in Fig. 21 1 the power will be assumed
positive in sign; if a ray is made to diverge by a surface, the power will
be assumed negative. Since refractive index is a ratio of velocities

The Rainbow

The explanation of the colours of the rainbow was first given by
Newton about 1667. He had already shown that sunlight consisted of a
mixture of colours ranging from red to

violet,

and that

glass could

disperse or separate the colours (p. 454). In the same way, he argued,
water droplets in the air dispersed the various colours in different
directions, so that the colours

of the spectrum were seen.

The curved appearance of the rainbow was first correctly explained
about 1611. It was attributed to refraction of light at a water drop,
followed by reflection inside the drop, the ray finally emerging into
the air as shown in Fig. 21.6. The primary bow is the rainbow usually
and is obtained by two refractions and one reflection at the drops,
Sometimes a secondary bow is seen higher in the sky,
and it is formed by rays undergoing two refractions and two reflections

seen,

as in Fig. 21.6.

refractive index of water for red light is 1*331. Substituting this value

can be found, and thus r is obtained. The deviation 8 can then be caland the acute angle between the incident and emergent red rays,
which is the supplement of 8, is about 42-1°. By substituting the refractive
index of water for violet light in (ii), the acute angle between the incident and
emergent violet rays is found to be about 40-2°. Thus if a shower of drops is
illuminated by the sun's rays, an observer standing with his back to the sun
sees a brilliant red light at an angle of 42-1° with the line joining the sun to
him, and a brilliant violet light at an angle of 40-2° with mis line, Fig. 21.6.
Since the phenomenon is the same in all planes passing through the line, the
brightly coloured drops form an arc of a circle whose centre is on the line.
The secondary bow is formed by two internal reflections in the water drops,
as illustrated in Fig. 21 .5 (ii) and Fig. 21.6. The minimum deviation occurs when

violet on the outside, whereas the primary bow colours are the reverse, Fig.
21.6.

REFRACTION THROUGH THIN LENSES
Converging and Diverging Lenses

At the beginning of the chapter we defined a lens as an object, usually
of glass, bounded by one or two spherical surfaces. Besides the converging (convex) lens shown in Fig. 21.1 (i) on p. 471, Fig. 21.9 (i) illustrates
two other types of converging lenses, which are thicker in the middle
than at the edges. Fig. 84 (ii) illustrates two types of diverging (concave)
lenses, a diverging lens being also shown in Fig. 21.1 (ii) on p. 471.

as a "diverging" lens.

Explanation of Effects of Lenses

thin lens may be regarded as made up of a very large number of
small-angle prisms placed together, as shown in the exaggerated sketches

imagined to be produced, the angles of the prisms can be seen to increase
from zero at the middle to a small value at the edge of the lens. Now
the deviation, d, of a ray of light
(n

—

1)

A, where A

is

by a small-angle prism is given by d =

the angle of the prism, see p. 457. Consequently the

truncated prism corresponding to a position farther away from the
middle of the lens deviates an incident ray more than those prisms nearer
the middle. Thus, for the case of the converging lens, the refracted rays
converge to the same point or focus F, Fig. 21.11 (i). It will be noted that
a ray AC incident on the middle, C, of the lens emerges parallel to AC,
since the middle acts like a rectangular piece of glass (p. 422). This fact is
utilised in the drawing of images in lenses (p. 485).
Since the diverging lens is made up of truncated prisms pointing the
opposite way to the converging lens, the deviation of the light is in the
opposite direction, Fig. 21.11 (ii). A divergent beam is hence obtained

when

parallel rays are refracted

by the

lens.

The Signs of Focal Length,/

From Fig. 21.1 1 (i), it can be seen that a convex lens has a real focus;
the focal length,/, of a converging lens is thus positive in sign. Since the
focus of a diverging lens is virtual, the focal length of such a lens is
negative in sign, Fig. 21.11 (ii). The reader must memorise the sign of/
for a converging and diverging lens respectively, as this is always required in connection with lens formulae.
Relations Between

Image and Object Distances

for Thin

Lens

We can now derive a relation between the object and image distances
when a lens is used. We shall limit ourselves to the case of a thin lens,
one whose thickness is small compared with its other dimensions,
and consider narrow beams of light incident on its central portion.
Suppose a lens of refractive index n 2 is placed in a medium of refractive
index n u and a point object O is situated on the principal axis, Fig. 21.12.

Focal Length of Lens. Small-angle Prism Method

The focal length /of a lens can also be found by using the deviation
formula due to a small-angle prism. Consider a ray PQ parallel to the
principal axis at a height h above it. Fig. 21.13 (i). This ray is refracted to
the principal focus, and thus undergoes a small deviation through an

is then moved along the axis of the lens until its image I is observed to
coincide with O when they are both viewed from above, the method
of no parallax being used. The distance from the pin O to the lens is
then the focal length,/, of the lens,
which can thus be measured.
The explanation of the method
is as follows. In general, rays from O
pass through the lens, are reflected
from the mirror M, and then pass
through the lens again to form an

This is only possible if the rays are incident normally on M. Consequently
the rays entering the lens after reflection are all parallel, and hence the
point to which they converge must be the focus, F, Fig. 21.26. It will thus
be noted that the mirror provides a simple method of obtaining parallel

placed in front of the lens, A, and an image I is obtained on a screen.
Keeping the object and screen fixed, the lens is then moved to a position
B so that a clear image is again obtained on the screen, Fig. 21.28. From
our discussion on p. 491, it follows that a magnified sharp image is
obtained at I when the lens is in the position A, and a diminished sharp
image when the lens is in the position B. If the displacement of the

An account of the essential features of the eye was given in Chapter
on

15

and it was mentioned there that the image formed by the eyelens L must appear on the retina R, the light-sensitive screen of the eye,
in order to be clearly seen, Fig. 22.1. The ciliary muscles enable the eye
to focus objects at different distances from it, a property of the eye
known as its power of accommodation. The most distant point it can
focus (the "far point") is at infinity for a normal eye; and as the ciliary
muscles are then completely relaxed, the eye is said to be "unaccommodated", or "at rest". In this case parallel rays entering the eye are
focused on the retina, Fig. 22.1 (i).

On the other hand, an object is seen in great detail when it is placed as
near the eye as it can be while remaining focused; this distance from
the eye known as its least distance of distinct vision. The point at this
distance from the eye is called its near point, and the distance is about
25 cm for a normal eye, Fig. 22.1 (ii). The eye is said to be "fully accom508

are then fully strained.

Short Sight
If the focal length of the eye is too short, owing to the eye-ball being
in front of
too long, parallel rays will be brought to a focus at a point
the retina, Fig. 22.2 (i). In this case the far point of the eye is not at
infinity, but at a point P nearer to the eye, and the defect of vision is
known as short sight, or myopia.

suitable diverging lens, L, is required to correct for short sight, Fig.
22.2 (ii). Parallel rays refracted through L are now made divergent, and
if they appear to come from the far point P of the eye, the rays are
brought to a focus on the retina R. From Fig. 22.2 (ii), it can be seen
that the focal length of the required lens is equal to PL, which is
practically equal to the distance of the far point from the eye.

Astigmatism
If the cornea, the refracting surface in front of the eye (p. 389), has
widely varying curvatures in different
planes, the rays from an object in one plane
will be brought to a focus by the eye at a
different place from rays in another plane.
In this case the lines in one direction in

DEFECTS OF LENSES

We have just considered defects inherent in the eye; we have now to
consider defects of an image produced by a lens, which is quite a
different matter.

placing a suitable diverging lens beside it. Except for the mathematics, the making of achromatic lenses is analogous to the case of
achromatic prisms, discussed on p. 459. There it was shown that two
prisms of different material, with angles pointing in opposite directions,

can act as an achromatic combination. Fig. 22.9 illustrates an achromatic
lens combination, known as an achromatic
doublet. The biconvex lens is made of
crown glass, while the concave lens is
made of flint glass and is a plano-concave

It should be noted that chromatic aberration would occur if the
diverging and converging lenses were made of the same material, as the
two lenses together would then constitute a single thick lens of one
material.

Condition for an Achromatic Combination

Achromatic lenses were first made about 1729, years after Newton
had considered they were impossible to construct. The necessary
condition for an achromatic combination of lenses is derived on p. 516.
Here we shall accept the result, which states: Two lenses form an achromatic doublet for two colours, if the ratio of their focal lengths is numeriof the corresponding dispersive powers (p. 459)
of their materials. Hence, since 2 ,/2 are of opposite signs because one
lens must be convex and the other concave,

Thus the distance between the lenses must be equal to the average of the

eye-piece (p. 519).

Spherical Aberration

We have now to consider another defect of an image due to a single
lens,

known as spherical aberration.

The

lens formula

—

\-~

— -~ has

been obtained by considering a
j
narrow beam of rays incident on the central portion of a lens. In this
case the angles of incidence and refraction at the surfaces of the lens
are small, and sin i and sin r can then be replaced respectively by i
and r in radians, as shown on p. 472. This leads to the lens formula and
a unique focus, F. If a wide parallel beam of light is incident on the
lens, however, experiment shows that the rays are not all brought to
the same focus, Fig. 22.10. It therefore follows that the image of an

as spherical aberration. The aberration may be reduced by

is

known

surrounding the lens with an opaque disc having a hole in the middle,
so that light is incident only on the middle of the lens, but this method
reduces the brightness of the image since it reduces the amount of light
energy passing through the lens.
As rays converge to a single focus for small angles of incidence,
spherical aberration can be diminished if the angles of incidence on
the lens' surfaces are diminished. In general, then, the deviation of the
light by a lens should be shared as equally as possible by its surfaces,
as each angle of incidence would then be as small as possible.
practical
method of reducing spherical aberration is to utilise two lenses, when four
surfaces are obtained, and to share the deviation equally between the
lenses. The lenses are usually plano-convex.

and F and E are at a distance 2/ apart, where/is the focal length of E.
Since 3/is the focal length of F, it follows from above that the eye-piece
eliminates chromatic aberration and reduces spherical aberration.
Since the image formed by the objective of a telescope is at a distance
equal to, or less than, the focal length of the eye lens E (p. 535), the
image I formed by the objective must be situated between F and E. This,
is the place where cross-wires must be placed if measurement of
the final image is required. But the cross-wires are viewed through
one lens, E, while the distant object is viewed by rays refracted through
both lenses, F, E. The relative lengths of the cross-wires and image are
thus rendered disproportionate, and hence cross-wires cannot be used

then,

a disadvantage.

Ramsden's Eye-piece

Ramsden's eye-piece is more commonly used than Huygens' eyeof two plano-convex lenses of equal focal length/, the

average of the focal lengths. If the field lens F were at the focus of the

The chromatic aberration of Ramsden's eye-piece is small, as is the

mentioned in previous pages.
Firstly, the image formed by the eye lens L must appear on the retina
R at the back of the eye if the object is to be clearly seen, Fig. 23.1.
Secondly, the normal eye can focus an object at infinity (the "far point"
of the normal eye), in which case the eye is said to be "unaccommodated".
Thirdly, the eye can see an object in greatest detail when it is placed at
a certain distance D from the eye, known as the least distance of distinct
vision, which is about 25 cm, for a normal eye (p. 508). The point at a
distance D from the eye is known as its "near point".

subtend the same visual angle 8 at the eye. The objects thus appear to
be of equal size, although the object at P is physically bigger than that

brought closer to the eye than the near point.

larger with their aid. Before they are used the object may subtend a

this is also popularly

known

as the magnifying power of the instrument. It should be carefully noted that we are concerned with visual
angles in the theory of optical instruments, and not with the physical
sizes

of the object and the image obtained.

Microscopes

At the beginning of the seventeenth century single lenses were
developed as powerful magnifying glasses, and many important discoveries in human and animal biology were made with their aid. Shortly
afterwards two or more convex lenses were combined to form powerful
microscopes, and with their aid Hooke, in 1648, discovered the existence
of "cells" in animal and vegetable tissue.

OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS

A microscope is an instrument used for viewing near objects. When
in normal use, therefore, the image formed by the microscope is
usually at the least distance of distinct vision, D, from the eye, i.e., at
the near point of the eye. With the unaided eye (i.e., without the in-

glass to view the same object. An erect, magnified image is obtained
when the object O is nearer to L than its focal length (p. 486), and the
observer moves the lens until the image at I is situated at his near point.
If the observer's eye is close to the lens at C, the distance IC is then equal
to D, the least distance of distinct vision, Fig. 23.3 (ii). Thus the new
visual angle a' is given by h'JD, where h! is the length of the virtual
image, and it can be seen that a is greater than o by comparing Fig.
23.3 (i) with Fig. 23.3 (ii).

The Best Position of the Eye. The Eye-Ring

When an object is viewed by an optical instrument, only those rays
from the object which are bounded by the perimeter of the objective
lens enter the instrument. The lens thus acts as a stop to the light from
the object. Similarly, the only rays from the image causing the sensation of vision are those which enter the pupil of the eye. The pupil thus
acts as a natural stop to the light from the image; and with a given
objective, the best position of the eye is one where it collects as much
light as possible from that passing through the objective.

Angular Magnification of Telescopes
Telescopes are instruments used for viewing distant objects, and they
are used extensively at sea and at astronomical observatories. The first
telescope is reputed to have been made about 1608, and in 1609 Galileo
made a telescope through which he observed the satellites of Jupiter
and the rings of Saturn. The telescope thus paved the way for great

astronomical discoveries, particularly in the hands of Kepler. Newton
also designed telescopes, and was the first person to suggest the use of
curved mirrors for telescopes free from chromatic aberration (see p. 513).

should be carefully noted that a is not the angle subtended at the

Astronomical Telescope in Normal Adjustment

An astronomical telescope made from lenses consists of an objective
of long focal length and an eye-piece of short focal length, for a reason
given on p. 534. Both lenses are converging. The telescope is in normal
adjustment when the final image is formed at infinity , and the eye is then
unaccommodated when viewing the image. The unaided eye is also
unaccommodated when the distant object is viewed, as the latter may
be considered to be at infinity.
Fig. 23.9 illustrates the formation of the final image when the telescope is used normally. The image I of the distant object is formed at
the focus, F , of the objective since the rays incident on the latter are
and since the final image is formed at infinity, the focus Fe
of the eye-piece must also be at F Fig. 23.9 shows three of the many

We can now obtain an expression for the angular magnification, M,
of the telescope; in so doing we shall assume that the eye is close to the
eye-piece. Since the length between the objective and the eye-piece
is very small compared with the distance of the object from either lens,
we can take the angle a subtended at the unaided eye by the object as
that subtended at the objective lens, Fig. 23.9. The angle a' subtended
at the eye when the telescope is used is given by a'

Thus the angular magnification is equal to the ratio of the focal

magnification, it follows from (6) that the objective should have a long
focal length and the eye-piece a short focal length.
It will

be noted that the distance between the lenses

is

equal to the

sum C/i + f£ of their focal lengths. This provides a simple method of
setting up two convex lenses to form an astronomical telescope when
their focal lengths are

known.

The Eye-ring, and Relation

to Angular Magnification

As we

explained in the case of the microscope, the rays which pass
through the telescope from the distant object are those bounded by the
objective lens. Fig. 23. 10 illustrates three rays from a point on the distant
object which pass through the objective, forming an image at Y. The

M, the best position for the eye, is the circular image of the
objective in the eye-piece L2, and we can calculate its position as

Galileo's Telescope

About 1610; with characteristic genius, Galileo designed a telescope
which provides an erect image of an object with the aid of only two
lenses. The Galilean telescope consists of an objective which is a converging lens of long focal length, and an eye-piece which is a diverging lens
of short focal length. The distance between the lenses is equal to
the difference in the magnitudes of their focal lengths, Le.,

1} in the absence of the diverging lens L2 but since L2 is at a distance/a from Ii» the rays falling on the
eye-piece are refracted through this lens so that they emerge parallel.
It will now be noted from Fig. 23.13 that an observer sees the top point
of the final image above the axis of the lenses, and hence the image is
the same way up as the distant object.
In Fig. 23.13, the rays converging to P emerge parallel after passing

is thus a virtual image in L of the virtual object P. But a ray C P through

Thus for high angular magnification, an objective of long focal

Advantage and Disadvantage of Galilean Telescope. Opera Glasses

QQ

The distance
between the objective and the eye-piece in the
Galilean telescope is (fx — f2); the distance between the same lenses in
the terrestrial telescope is (/i
4/), p. 537. Thus the Galilean
f2
telescope is a much shorter instrument than the terrestrial telescope,
and is therefore used for opera glasses.
As already explained (p. 532), the eye-ring is the image of the objective
in the eye-piece. But the eye-piece is a diverging lens. Thus the eye-ring

+

is

virtual,

+

and corresponds to M, which is between L x and L 2 (Fig. 23. 1 3).

Since it is impossible to place the eye at M, the best position of the eye
in the circumstances is as close as possible to the eye-piece 1^, and
consequently the field of view of the Galilean telescope is very limited
compared with that of the astronomical or terrestrial telescope. This is
a disadvantage of the Galilean telescope.
Final

Image at Near Point

The final image in a Galilean telescope can also be viewed at the
near point of the eye, when the telescope is not in normal adjustment.

Measurement of magnifying power of telescope and microscope

Method 1. The magnifying power of a telescope can be measured by placing
a well-illuminated large scale S at one end of the laboratory, and viewing it
through the telescope at the other end. If the telescope consists of converging
lenses O, E acting as objective and eye-piece respectively, the distance

Fig. 23.15. Measurement of magnifying power.

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

540

between O, E is the sum of their focal lengths when the instrument is in normal
use (p. 534), Fig. 23. 1 5. By means of a plane mirror
and a plane piece of glass
P, the divisions on the scale S can be superimposed on its image seen through

M

the telescope, and the ratio of the divisions in equal lengths of the field of view
can thus be detennined. Since the ratio of the angles subtended at the eye by
the image and by the scale is equal to the ratio, a, of the divisions, the magnifying power is equal to a. There must be no parallax between the scale and the
final

image.

Method 2. The magnifying power of a telescope is the ratio of the diameters
of the objective and eye-ring (p. 535). The eye-ring is the image of the objective
in the eye-piece, and is obtained by pointing the telescope to the sky and
holding a ground glass screen near the eye-piece.
circle, which is the image
of the objective in the eye-piece, is observed on the screen, and its diameter,
d, is measured. The magnifying power is then given by the ratio d jd, where
do is the diameter of the objective.
This method is particularly useful when the telescope is fixed in a tube, as
it is in practice. When a telescope is set up as in Fig. 23.10, a piece of cardboard
with a circular hole can be placed round the objective lens to define its
diameter, and the eye-ring found by placing a screen near the eye-piece.
The magnifying power of a microscope can be found by placing two similar
scales in front of it, one being 25 cm from the eye. The other scale is placed
near the objective, and the eye-piece is moved until the image of this scale
coincides with the first scale by the method of no parallax, both eyes being
used. The magnifying power is then given by the ratio of the number of divisions
occupying the same length.

A

Prism Binoculars
Prism binoculars are widely used as field glasses, and consist of short
astronomical telescopes containing two right-angled isosceles prisms
between the objective and eye-piece, Fig. 23. 16. These lenses are both converging, and they would produce an inverted image of the distant object
if they were alone used. The purpose of the two prisms is to invert the
image and obtain a final erect image.
One prism A, is placed with its refracting edge vertical, while the
other, B, is placed with its refracting edge horizontal. As shown in

the same way up as the image in front of it, and hence the final image is
the same way up as the distant object.
Fig. 23.16 illustrates the path of two rays through the optical system.
Since the optical path of a ray is about 3 times the distance d between
the objective and the eye-piece, the system is equivalent optically to

Camera

The pinhole camera consists essentially of a closed box with a pinhole
in front and a photographic plate at the back on which the image is
formed. The principle was first discovered by Porta about 1600, who
found that clear images were formed on a screen at the back of the box
when objects were placed in front of the pinhole.

Depth of Field

An object will not be seen by the eye until its image on the retina
covers at least the area of a single cone, which transmits along the optic
nerve light energy just sufficient to produce the sensation of vision. As

clear pictures of objects at different distances. Consider a point object

enough light from very distant stars and planets to be collected and
brought to a focus for them to be photographed. Special cameras are
incorporated in the instrument to photograph the universe. This method
has the advantage that plates can be exposed for hours, if necessary, to
the object to be studied, enabling records to be made. It is used to
obtain useful information about the building-up and breaking-down of

Bradley's Aberration

Method

Romer's conclusions about the velocity of light were ignored by the
of his time. In 1729, however, the astronomer Bradley
observed that the angular elevation of a "fixed" star varied slightly
according to the position of the earth in its orbit round the sun. For
some time he was puzzled by the observation. But while he was being
rowed across a stream one day, he noticed that the boat drifted slightly
downstream; and he saw immediately that the difference between the
actual and observed angular elevation of the star was due to a comscientists

bination of the velocity of the earth in its orbit (analogous to the velocity
of the stream) with that of the velocity of light (analogous to the velocity
of the boat). Thus if the earth were stationary, a telescope T would have
to point in the true direction AS of a star S to observe it; but since the
earth is moving in its orbit round the sun with a velocity v, T would
have to be directed along
to observe the star, where

A Terrestrial Method

In 1849 Fizeau succeeded in measuring the velocity of light with
apparatus on the earth, for the first time. His method, unlike ROmer's
and Bradley's method, is thus known as a terrestrial method.

of B, and the light thus emerges parallel after refraction through the
latter and travels several miles to another lens C. This lens brings the
light to a focus at M, where a silvered plane mirror is positioned, and
the light is now returned back along its original path to the glass plate F.
An image of O can thus be observed through F by a lens E.
The rim of a toothed wheel, W, which can rotate about a horizontal
axis Q, is placed at H, and is the important feature of Fizeau's method.

Fizeau used a wheel with 720 teeth, and first obtained a dark field
of view through E when the rate of revolution was 12-6 revs per second.
The distance from H to

light to travel from H to
and back
2 x 8633 jc seconds, where c is
the velocity of light in metres per second. But this is the time taken by a
tooth to move to a position corresponding to a neighbouring gap. Since
there are 2 x 720 teeth and gaps together, the time

The disadvantage of Fizeau's method is mainly that the field of view
can never be made perfectly dark, owing to the light diffusedly reflected
at the teeth towards E. To overcome this disadvantage the teeth of the
wheel were bevelled, but a new and more accurate method of determining the velocity of fight was devised by Foucault in 1862.
Foucault's Rotating Mirror

Method

M

In Foucault's method a plane mirror
x is rotated at a high constant
angular velocity about a vertical axis at A, Fig. 24.6.
lens L is placed
so that light from a bright source at x is reflected at Mi and comes to a
focus at a point P on a concave mirror C. The centre of curvature of C
is at A, and consequently the light is reflected back from C along its
original path, giving rise to an image coincident with Ox. In order to
observe the image, a plate of glass
is placed at 45° to the axis of the
lens, from which the light is reflected to form an image at B

Suppose the plane mirror Mj begins to rotate. The light reflected by

rotation is 2 revs per sec, an intermittent image is seen. As the speed
of x is increased to about 10 revs per sec the image is seen continuously
as a result of the rapid impressions on the retina. As the speed is increased further, the light reflected from the mirror flashes across from
Mj to C, and returns to Mi to find it displaced by a very small angle 6

The angle 6 can also be expressed in terms of the velocity of light, c,

time taken to rotate through an angle 6 radians is dj2izm sees. But this

As m, a, I, b are known, and the displacement y

The disadvantage of Foucault's method is mainly that the image
obtained is not very bright, making observation difficult. Michelson
(p. 559) increased the brightness of the image by placing a large lens
between the plane mirror and C, so that light was incident on C for a
greater fraction of the mirror's revolution. Since the distance a was
increased at the same time, Fig. 24.7, the displacement of the image was
also increased.

The velocity of light in water was observed by Foucault, who placed
a pipe of water between the plane mirror and C. He found that, with

was used, the displacement y of the image B was greater. Since the
velocity of light = %7ima2 ll{a + b) y, from (3), it follows that the velocity

the

Michelson's Method for the Velocity of light

The velocity of light, c, is a quantity which appears in many fundamental formulae in advanced Physics, especially in connection with the
theories concerning particles in atoms and calculations on atomic
(nuclear) energy. Einstein has shown, for example, that the energy
mc 2 joules, where/M is the decrease
released from an atom is given by
in mass of the atom in kilogrammes and c the velocity of light in metres
per second. A knowledge of the magnitude of c is thus important. A. A.
Michelson, an American physicist, spent many years of his life in
measuring the velocity of light, and the method he devised is regarded
as one of the most accurate.
The essential features of Michelson's apparatus are shown in Fig. 24.8.
is an equiangular octagonal steel prism which can be rotated at
constant speed about a vertical axis through its centre. The faces of the
prism are highly polished, and the light passing through a slit from a
very bright source O is reflected at the surface A towards a plane
mirror B. From B the light is reflected to a plane mirror L, which is
placed so that the image of O formed by this plane mirror is at the focus
of a large concave mirror HD. The light then travels as a parallel

increased and suitably adjusted, however, the image reappears and is

from A now arrives at the opposite surface in the time taken for the prism

Photometry
Standard Candle. The Candela
Light is a form of energy which stimulates the sensation of vision. The
sun emits a continuous stream of energy, consisting of ultra-violet,
visible, and infra-red radiations (p. 344), all of which enter the eye; but
only the energy in the visible radiations, which is called luminous energy,
stimulates the sensation of vision. In Photometry we are concerned only
with the luminous energy emitted by a source of light.
Years ago the luminous energy per second from a candle of specified

wax material and wick was used as a standard of luminous energy.
This was called the British Standard Candle. The luminous energy per
second from any other source of light was reckoned in terms of the
standard candle, and its value was given at 10 candle-power (10 c.p.)
for example. As the standard candle was difficult to reproduce exactly,
the standard was altered. It was defined as one-tenth of the intensity of
the flame of the Vernon Harcourt pentane lamp, which burns a mixture
of air and pentane vapour under specified conditions. Later it was
agreed to use as a standard the international standard candle, which is
defined in terms of the luminous energy per second from a particular
electric lamp filament maintained under specified conditions, but the
precision of this standard was found to be unsatisfactory. In 1948, a
unit known as the candela, symbol "cd", was adopted. This is defined
as the luminous intensity of 1/600 000 metre 2 (1/60 cm 2) of the surface
of a black body at the temperature of freezing platinum under 101 325
newtons per metre 2 pressure.

Physical Laboratory.

Luminous Flux,

F

In practice a source of light emits a continuous stream of energy, and
the name luminous flux has been given to the luminous energy emitted
per second. The unit of luminous flux is the lumen, lm. Since a lumen is
a certain amount of "energy per second", or "power", there must be a
relation between the lumen and the watt, the mechanical unit of power
and experiment shows that 621 lumens of a green light of wavelength
5-540 x 10 -10
is equivalent to 1 watt.

Solid Angle

A

lamp radiates luminous flux in all directions round it. If we think
of a particular small lamp and a certain direction from it, for example
that of the corner of a table, we can see that the flux is radiated towards

photometry must therefore include a discussion of the measurement of
an angle in three dimensions, such as that of a cone, which is known as a
<

solid angle.

An angle in two dimensions, i.e., in a plane, is given in radians by the
s/r, where s is the length of the arc cut off by the bounding lines
of the angle on a circle of radius r. In an analogous manner, the solid
angle, co, of a cone is defined by the relation

where S is the area of the surface of a sphere of radius r cut off by the

where F is the luminous flux contained in the small cone. Thus the
luminous intensity of the source is the luminous flux per unit solid angle
in the particular direction. It can now be seen that "luminous intensity"
is a measure of the "luminous flux density" in the direction concerned.
The unit of luminous intensity of a source is the candela, defined on
p.. 562, and the luminous intensity was formerly known as the candlepower of the source. When the luminous flux, F, in the cone in Fig. 24.12
is 1 lumen (the unit of luminous flux), and the solid angle, to, of the cone
is 1 unit, it follows from equation (6) that
candela. Thus the
lumen can be defined as the luminous flux radiated within unit solid angle
by a uniform source of one candela. A small source of / candela radiates

these were the metre-candle or the lux (lx), which is the SI unit, the

The reader should take pains to

distinguish carefully between

the meaning of "luminous intensity'* and "illumination" and their
units. The former refers to the source of light and is measured in
candelas (formerly candle-power); the latter refers to the surface
illuminated and is measured in lux or metre-candles. Further,
"luminous intensity" is defined in terms of unit solid angle, which concerns three dimensions whereas "illumination" is defined in terms of
unit area, which concerns

two dimensions.

Luminance of a Surface: Reflection and Transmission Factors

The luminance of a surface in a given direction is denned as the
luminous flux per unit area coming from the surface in the particular
direction. The luminance of white paint on the wall of a room is considerably higher than the luminance of a brown-painted panel in the
middle of the wall; the luminance of a steel nib is much greater than that
of a dark ebonite penholder.
The "luminance" of a particular surface should be carefully distinguished from the "illumination" of the surface, which is the luminous
incident on the surface. Thus the illumination of white
flux per sq
chalk on a particular blackboard is practically the same as that of the
neighbouring points on the board itself, whereas the luminance of the
chalk is much greater than that of the board. The difference in lumin-

Comparison of Luminous

In general, the brightness of the central and outer portions of the

appears darker than the other. By moving one of the sources, however,
a position is obtained when both portions appear equally bright, in
which case they cannot be distinguished from each other and the field of
view is uniformly bright.

Simple harmonic motion (S.H.M.) occurs when the force acting on
an object or system is directly proportional to its displacement x from
a fixed point and is always directed towards this point. If the object
executes S.H.M., then the variation of the displacement x with time t

total energy in the vibration* Further, it was shown that the time
averages of the potential energy (P. E.) and kinetic energy (K.E.) are
equal; each is half the total energy. In any mechanical oscillation, there
is a continuous interchange or exchange of energy from P.E. to K.E. and

For vibrations to occur, therefore, an agency is required which can
possess and store P.E. and another which can possess and store K.E.
This was the case for a mass oscillating on the end of a spring, as we
saw on

p. 50. The mass stores K.E. and the spring stores P.E.; and
interchange occurs continuously from one to the other as the spring is
compressed and released alternately. In the oscillations of a simple
pendulum, the mass stores K.E. as it swings downwards from the end
of an oscillation, and this is changed to P.E. as the height of the bob

some agency is needed to accomplish the transfer of energy.
In the case of the mass and spring, the force in the spring causes the
transfer. In the case of the pendulum, the component of the weight
along the arc of the circle causes the change from P.E. to K.E.

Electrical Oscillations

So far we have dealt with mechanical oscillations and energy. The
energy in electrical oscillations takes a different form. There are still two
types of energy. One is the energy stored in the electric field, and the
other that stored in the magnetic field. To obtain electrical oscillations,

p.d. then exists across the capacitor and an electric field is

and since the current is zero there is no magnetic energy. Because
of the p.d. a current will begin to flow and magnetic energy will begin to be
stored in the inductor. Thus there will be a change from electric to magnetic
energy. The p.d. is the agency which causes the transfer of energy.
One quarter of a cycle later the capacitor will be fully discharged and the
current will be at its greatest, so that the energy is now entirely stored in the
magnetic field, Fig. 25.2 (ii). The current continues to flow for a further
quarter-cycle until the capacitor is fully charged in the opposite direction,
when the energy is again completely stored in the electric field, Fig. 25.2 (hi).
The current then reverses and the processes occur in reverse order, Fig. 25.2

Damped

Vibrations

In practice, the amplitude of vibration in simple harmonic motion
does not remain constant but becomes progressively smaller. Such a
vibration is said to be damped. The diminution of amplitude is due to
loss of energy; for example, the amplitude of the bob of a simple
pendulum diminishes slowly owing to the viscosity (friction) of the air.
This is shown by curve 1 in Fig. 25.4.

motion.

The general behaviour of mechanical systems subject to various amounts
of damping may be conveniently investigated using a coil of a ballistic
galvanometer (p. 919). If a resistor is connected to the terminals of a ballistic
galvanometer when the coil is swinging, the induced emf due to the motion of
the coil in the magnetic field of the galvanometer magnet causes a current to
flow through the resistor. This current, by Lenz's Law (p. 896), opposes the
motion of the coil and so causes damping. The smaller the value of the
resistor, the greater is the degree of damping. The galvanometer coil is set
swinging by discharging a capacitor through it. The time period, and the time
taken for the amplitude to be reduced to a certain fraction of its original
value, are then measured. The experiment can then be repeated using different
values of resistor connected to the terminals.

period increases and
It is found that as the damping is increased the time
the oscillations die away more quickly. As the damping is increased further
there is a value of resistance which is just sufficient to prevent the coil from
vibrating past its rest position. This degree of damping, called the critical
damping, reduces the motion to rest in the shortest possible time. If the resistance

Forced Oscillations. Resonance
In order to keep a system, which has a degree of damping, in continuous oscillatory motion, some external periodic force must be used.
The frequency of this force is called the forcing frequency. In order to
see how systems respond to a forcing oscillation, we may use an
electrical circuit comprising a coil L, capacitor C and resistor J?, shown
in Fig. 25.5 (see also p. 976).

The applied oscillating voltage is displayed on the Y2 plates of a doublebeam oscilloscope (p. 101 1). The voltage across the resistor R is displayed on
the Yj plates. Since the current / through the resistor is given by / = V/R,
the voltage across &, is a measure of the current through the circuit. The
frequency of the oscillator is now set to a low value and the amplitude of the
display is recorded. The frequency is then increased slightly and the
amplitude again measured. By taking many such readings, a graph can be

Waves and Wave-motion

A wave allows energy to be transferred from one point to another
some distance away without any particles of the medium travelling
between the two points. For example, if a small weight is suspended by
a string, energy to move the weight may be obtained by repeatedly
shaking the other end of the string up and down through a small

Principle of Superposition

When two waves travel through a medium, their combined effect at
any point can be found by the Principle of Superposition. This states that
the resultant displacement at any point is the sum of the separate displacements due to the two waves.
The principle can be illustrated by means of a long stretched spring
('Slinky'). If wave pulses are produced at each end simultaneously, the
two waves pass through the wire. Fig. 25.13(a) shows the stages which
occur as the two pulses pass each other. In Fig. 25. 13(a) (i), they are some
distance apart and are approaching each other, and in Fig. 25. 13(a) (ii)

by broken lines, are partly overlapping. The resultant is the sum of
the two curves. In Fig. 25.13(a) (iv), the two pulses exactly overlap
and the greatest resultant is obtained. The last diagram shows the
pulses receding from one another. The diagrams in Fig. 25.13(b) show
the same sequence of events (i)-(v) but tne pulses are equal and opposite.

a number of stationary vibrating loops are seen on the string when one
is set vibrating. This time the wave-like profile on the string does
not move along the medium, which is the string, and the wave is therefore called a stationary (or standing) wave.
The motion of the string when a stationary wave is produced can be
seen by using a Xenon stroboscope (strobe). This instrument gives a

a darkened room and illuminated with the strobe. When the frequency
of the strobe is nearly equal to that of the string, the string can be seen
moving up and down slowly. Its' observed frequency is equal to the
difference between the frequency of the strobe and that of the string.

The

following points should be noted:
There are points such as B where the displacement is permanently
zero. These points are called nodes of the stationary wave.
2. At points between successive nodes the vibrations are in phase.
This property of the stationary wave is in sharp contrast to the progressive wave, where the phase of points near each other are all different
(see p. 585). Thus when one point of a stationary wave is at its maximum
displacement, all points are then at their maximum displacement. When
a point (other than a node) has zero displacement, all points then have
1.

zero displacement.
3. Each point along the

wave has a different amplitude of vibration
from neighbouring points. Again this is different from the case of a
progressive wave, where every point vibrates with the same amplitude.
Points, e.g. C, which have the greatest amplitude are called antinodes.

Equation

In deriving the wave equation of a progressive wave, we used the fact
from point to point (p. 586). In the case of a
stationary wave, we may find the equation of motion by considering the
amplitude of vibration at each point because the amplitude varies while
the phase remains constant.
Let ay be the angular frequency of the wave. The vibration of each
particle may be represented by the equation

(8)

Y is the amplitude of the vibration at the point considered.
Y varies along the wave with the distance x from some origin. If we

where

suppose the origin to be at an antinode, then the origin will have the
greatest amplitude, A, say. Now the wave repeats at every distance A,
and it can be seen that the amplitudes at different points vary sinusoidally
with their particular distance x. An equation representing the changing
amplitude Y along the wave is thus:

Wave

Properties, Reflection and Refraction

Any wave motion can be reflected. The reflection of light and sound
waves, for example, is discussed on pp. 677, 613 respectively.
Waves can also be refracted, that is, their direction changes when
they enter a new medium. This is due to the change in velocity of the
waves on entering a different medium. Refraction of light and sound,
for example, is discussed later (pp. 679, 615).

water waves in a ripple tank, with which we assume the reader is
familiar. Fig. 25.16(i) shows the effect of widening the aperture and
Fig. 25.16(H) the effect of shortening the wavelength

and keeping the
same width of opening. In certain circumstances in diffraction, reinforcement of the waves, or complete cancellation occurs in particular
directions from the aperture, as shown in Fig. 25.16(i) and (ii). These
patterns are called 'diffraction bands' (p. 701).

Fig. 25.16

Diffraction of waves.

Generally, the smaller the width of the aperture in relation to the
wavelength, the greater is the spreading or diffraction of the waves.
This explains why we cannot see round corners. The wavelength of light
waves is about 6 x 10 _5 cm (p. 690). This is so short that no appreciable
diffraction is obtained around obstacles of normal size. With very small
obstacles or narrow apertures, however, diffraction of light may be
appreciable (see p. 707). Sound waves have long wavelengths, for
example 50 cm, so that diffraction of sound waves occurs easily. For
this reason, it is possible to hear round corners. Electromagnetic waves
can be diffracted, as shown on p. 989.
Interference

When two or more waves of the same frequency overlap, the
phenomenon of interference occurs. Interference is easily demonstrated
in a ripple tank. Two sources, A and B, of the same frequency are used.
These produce circular waves which spread out and overlap, and the
pattern seen on the water surface is shown in Fig. 25.17.
The interference pattern can be explained from the Principle of
Superposition (p. 588). If the oscillations of A and B are in phase, crests
from .A will arrive at the same time as crests from B at any point on
the line RS. Hence by the Principle of Superposition there will be

will arrive before corresponding crests from B. In fact, every

along the line MN, alternate loud (L) and soft (S) sounds are heard
according to whether the receiver of sound is on a line of reinforcement
(constructive interference) or cancellation (destructive interference) of
waves. Fig. 25.18 (i) indicates the positions of loud and soft sounds if
the two speakers oscillate in phase. If the connections to one of the
speakers is reversed, so that they oscillate out of phase, then the pattern
is altered as shown in Fig. 25.18(ii). The reader should try to account
for this difference.

SOUND RECEPTION, REPRODUCTION, RECORDING
The Ear

The eye can detect colour changes, which are due to the different
frequencies of the light waves; it can also detect variations in brightness, which are due to the different amounts of light energy it receives.
In the sphere of sound, the ear is as sensitive as the eye; it can detect
notes of different pitch, which are due to the different frequencies of
sound waves, and it can also detect loud and soft notes, which are due
to different amounts of sound energy falling on the ear per second.
We are not concerned in this book with the complete physiology of
the ear. Among other features, it consists of the outer ear, A, a canal C

and bones called the ossicles, Fig. 25.19. The
of a bone called the 'hammer', fitting into another bone
called the 'anvil', which is connected to the third bone called the
'stirrup'. When sound waves occur in the neighbourhood of the ear, they
travel down the Canal to the drumskin, which is also set into vibration.
The part of the hammer in contact with the drumskin then vibrates,
and strikes the anvil at the same rate. The motion is thus communicated
to the stirrup, and from here it passes by a complicated mechanism to
the auditory nerves, which set up the sensation of sound.
In 1843, Ohm asserted that the ear perceives a simple harmonic
vibration of the air as a simple or pure note. Although the waveforms
of notes from instruments are far from being simple harmonic (see
p. 610), the ear appears able to analyse a complicated waveform into
the sum of a number of simple harmonic waves, which it then detects
leading to the drumskin,
ossicles consist

as separate notes.

Carbon microphone, Fig. 25.20. This type of microphone is used in the

resistance decreases on compression and increases on release. Thus
when sound waves are incident on the diaphragm D, a varying electric
current of the same sound or audio frequency is produced along the
telephone wires. The carbon microphone is a 'pressure' type since the
magnitude of the current depends on the pressure changes in the air.

to a large baffle-board B which surrounds it.
When C carries audio-frequency current, it vibrates at the same
frequency in the direction of its axis. This is due to the force on a currentcarrying conductor in a magnetic field, ,Fig. 25.24, whose direction is
given by Fleming's left-hand rule. Since the surface area of the cone is
large, the large mass of air in contact with it is disturbed and hence a
loud sound is produced.

Sound Recording and Reproduction

We now

consider the principles of recording sound on tape and on
and its reproduction. Details are beyond the scope of this book
and must be obtained from manuals on the subject.
Tape recorder. Fig. 25.26 (i) illustrates the principle of tape recording
in which flexible tape is used. It is coated with a fine uniform layer of
a special form of ferric oxide which can be magnetised. The backing
is a smooth plastic-base tape. When recording, the tape moves at a
constant speed past the narrow gap between the poles of a ring of
soft iron which has a coil round it. The coil carries the audio-frequency
(af) current due to the sound recorded. On one half of a cycle, that part
of the moving tape then in the gap is unmagnetised. On the other half
of the same cycle, the next piece of tape in the gap is magnetised in the
opposite direction, as shown. The rate at which pairs of such magnets
is produced is equal to the frequency of the af current. The strength of
the magnets is a measure of the magnetising current and hence of the
intensity of the sound recorded.
In 'playback', the magnetised tape is now run at exactly the same
speed past the same or another ring, the playback head, Fig. 25.26 (ii).
As the small magnets pass the gap between the poles, the flux in the
iron changes. An induced emf is thus obtained of the same frequency

and passed to the loudspeaker, which reproduces the sound.
To obtain high-quality sound reproduction from tape, the output
from a special high frequency bias oscillator is applied to the recording
head in addition to the recording signal. This ensures that the magnets
formed on the tape have strengths which are proportional to the recording signal. If the bias oscillator was not used, severe distortion due to

Frequency of Tuning-fork. Falling Plate Method
1
Comparison method. A tuning-fork is often used in experiments in
sound to provide a note of known frequency. One method of measuring
the frequency of a fork P is to compare it with the known frequency of
another fork Q by a 'falling plate method'. One end of P is clamped
in a vice; a light bristle B is attached to a prong, and rests lightly near
the bottom of a smoked glass plate G, Fig. 25.29. The fork Q is similarly
placed, and a bristle C, attached to one of its prongs, rests lightly on G.
Both forks are sounded by drawing a bow across them, and the thread S

The Stroboscope

A stroboscope is an arrangement which can make a rotating object
appear at rest when it is viewed, and thus enables a spinning wheel, for
example, to be studied at leisure. The stroboscopic method can be
used to determine the frequency of a tuning-fork, which is electrically
maintained for the purpose.

white card C with black dots spaced at equal distances round the circumference, and the dots on the card can be seen through S. The tuningfork is set into vibration, and the card is rotated by a motor about a
horizontal axis through its centre with increasing speed. At first an
observer O, viewing the dots through S, sees them moving round in an
opposite direction to that in which the card is rotated. This is because
the intermittent glimpses of the card through S occur quicker than the
time taken for one dot to reach the place of the dot in front of it, with
the result that the dots appear to be moving slowly back. As the speed
of the card is increased further, a stage is reached when the dots appear

quality; so that if each of these three quantities

known, the note

is

completely defined or "char-

acterised".

Pitch
Pitch is analogous to colour in light, which is characterised by the
wavelength, or by the frequency, of the electromagnetic vibrations
(p. 690). Similarly, the pitch of a note depends only on the frequency of
the vibrations, and a high frequency gives rise to a high-pitched note.
low frequency produces a low-pitched note. Thus the high-pitched
whistle of a boy may have a frequency of several thousand Hz, whereas
the low-pitched hum due to A.C. mains frequency when first switched
on may be a hundred Hz. The range of sound frequencies is about 15
to 20000 Hz and depends on the observer.

of the higher note is recognised to be an upper
octave of the lower note. A note of frequency 1000 Hz is recognised
to be an upper octave of a note of frequency 500 Hz, and thus the
musical interval between two notes is an upper octave if the ratio of
their frequencies is 2:1. It can be shown that the musical interval
between two notes depends on the ratio of their frequencies, and
not on the actual frequencies. The table below shows the various

sound at a place is defined as the energy per second
flowing through one square metre held normally at that place to the
direction along which the sound travels. As we go farther away from a
source of sound the intensity diminishes, since the intensity decreases
as the square of the distance from the source (see also p. 565).

It can be seen from (ii) that the greater the mass
of air in vibration,
the greater is the intensity of the sound obtained. For this reason the
sound set up by the vibration of the diaphragm of a telephone earpiece
cannot be heard except with the ear close to the earpiece. On the other
hand, the cone of a loudspeaker has a large surface area, and thus
disturbs a large mass of air when it vibrates, giving rise to a sound of
much larger intensity than the vibrating diaphragm of the telephone
earpiece. It is difficult to hear a vibrating tuning-fork a small distance

Loudness is a sensation, and hence, unlike intensity, it is difficult to
measure because it depends on the individual observer. Normally, the
greater the intensity, the greater is the loudness of the sound (see p. 607).

sounds the same to the ear when the frequency increases from 100 to
200 Hz as from 500 to 1000 Hz. Similarly, it is found that increases in
loudness depend on the ratio of the intensities, and not on the absolute
differences in intensity.

If the power of a source of sound increases from 01 watt to 0-2 watt,
and then from 0-2 watt to 0-4 watt, the loudness of the source to the
ear increases in equal steps. The equality is thus dependent on the
equality of the ratio of the powers, not their difference, and in commercial practice the increase in loudness is calculated by taking the
logarithm of the ratio of the powers to the base 10, which is log 10 2, or
0-3, in this case.

Relative intensities or powers are expressed in bels, after Graham

At a point 10 m from the speaker the intensity will be four times greater
than at 20 m. The intensity level here is thus 10 + 6 or 16 db.
If the electrical power supplied to the loudspeaker is doubled, the
sound intensity at each point is doubled. Thus if the original intensity
level was 16 db, the new intensity level is higher by 10 log 10 2 db or
about 3 db. The new intensity level is hence 19 db.

Loudness. The Phon

The loudness of a sound

is

a sensation, and thus depends on the

observer, whereas power, or intensity, of a sound is independent of the
observer. Observations show that sounds which appear equally loud
to a person have different intensities or powers, depending on the

frequency, /, of the sound. The curves a, b, c represent respectively
three values of equal loudness, and hence the intensity at X, when the
frequency is 1000 Hz, is less than the intensity at Y, when the frequency is 500, although the loudness is the same, Fig. 26.1.

Fig. 26.1. Curves of equal loudness.

In order to measure loudness, therefore, scientists have adopted a
"standard" source having a frequency of 1000 Hz, with which all other
sounds are compared. The source
whose loudness is required is
placed near the standard source, and the latter is then altered until the
loudness is the same as H. The intensity or power level of the standard
source is then measured, and if this is n decibels above the threshold
~
value (10 10 microwatt per sq cm, p. 609) the loudness is said to be
nphons. The phon, introduced in 1936, is thus a unit of loudness, whereas
the decibel is a unit of intensity or power. Noise meters, containing a
microphone, amplifier, and meter, are used to measure loudness, and
are calibrated directly in phons. The "threshold of feeling", when
sound produces a painful sensation to the ear, corresponds to a loudness
of about 120 phons.

H

Quality or Timbre
If the same note is sounded on the violin and then on the piano, an
untrained listener can tell which instrument is being used, without
seeing it. We say that the quality or timbre of the note is different in
each case.
The waveform of a note is never simple harmonic in practice; the
nearest approach is that obtained by sounding a tuning-fork, which
thus produces what may be called a "pure" note, Fig. 26.2 (i). If the
same note is played on a violin and piano respectively, the waveforms
produced might be represented by Fig. 26.2 (ii), (iii), which have the
same frequency and amplitude as the waveform in Fig. 26.2 (i). Now
curves of the shape of Fig. 26.2 (ii), (iii) can be analysed mathematically
into the sum of a number of simple harmonic curves, whose frequencies
are multiples of/ , the frequency of the original waveform; the amplitudes of these curves diminish as the frequency increases. Fig. 26.2 (iv),
for example, might be an analysis of a curve similar to Fig. 26.2 (iii),
corresponding to a note on a piano. The ear is able to detect simple
harmonic waves (p. 595), and thus registers the presence of notes of
frequencies 2/ and 3/ , in addition to/ , when the note is sounded on
the piano. The amplitude of the curve corresponding to/Q is greatest,

side heard a note if the wave contained the frequency to which the
resonator responded. By using resonators of various sizes, which were
themselves singularly free from overtones, Helmholtz analysed the
notes obtained from different instruments.
Theory of Resonator

We shall now see how the frequency of a
resonator depends on the volume Kof air inside it; and to define the situation, suppose
we have a bottle with a narrow neck of crosssectional area a and containing air of mass

PROPERTIES OF SOUND WAVES
Reflection

Like light waves, sound waves are reflected from a plane surface so
is equal to the angle of reflection. This can
be demonstrated by placing a tube Tx in front of a plane surface AB
and blowing a whistle gently at S, Fig. 26.5. Another tube T 2 directed
towards N, is placed on the other side of the normal NQ, and moved
until a sensitive flame (see p. 650),
or a microphone connected to a
cathode-ray tube, is considerably
affected at R, showing that the
reflected wave passes along NR.
It will then be found that angle

Acoustics of Rooms. Reverberation

A

concert-hall, lecture-room, or a broadcasting studio requires special
design to be acoustically effective. The technical problems concerned
were first investigated in 1906 by Sabine in America, who was consulted about a hall in which it was difficult for an audience to hear
the lecturer.
Generally, an audience in a hall hears sound from different directions

They hear

sound directly from the speaker or
sound from echoes produced by walls
and ceilings, (c) sound diffused from the walls and ceilings and other
objects present. The echoes are due to regular reflection at a plane

of a speaker thus overlapped the sound due to the next dozen
or so syllables, making the speech difficult to comprehend. The quality
of a sound depends on the time of reverberation. If the time is very
short, for example 0-5 second, the music from an orchestra sounds thin
or lifeless; if the time too long the music sounds muffled. The reverberation time at a B.B.C. concert-hall used for orchestral performances
is about If seconds, whereas the reverberation time for a dance-band
studio is about 1 second.
syllable

Sabine's Investigations. Absorptive

Power

Sabine found that the time T of reverberation depended on the
volume V of the room, its surface area A, and the absorptive power, a,
of the surfaces. The time Tis given approximately by

T _kV

aA>

where k

a constant. In general some sound is absorbed and the rest
is reflected; if too much sound is reflected T is large. If many thick
curtains are present in the room too much sound is absorbed and T is
is

small.

Sabine chose the absorptive power of unit area of an open window as
the unit, since this is a perfect absorber. On this basis the absorptive
power of a person in an audience, or of thick carpets and rugs, is 0-5,
linoleum has an absorptive power of 012, and polished wood and glass
have an absorptive power of 001. The absorptive power of a material
depends on its pores to a large extent; this is shown by the fact that an

.

PROPERTIES AND VELOCITY OF

SOUND WAVES

615

unpainted brick has a high absorptive power, whereas the painted brick
has a low absorptive power.
From Sabine's formula for Tit follows that the time of reverberation
can be shortened by having more spectators in the hall concerned, or
by using felt materials to line some of the walls or ceiling. The seats
in an acoustically-designed lecture-room have plush cushions at their
backs to act as an absorbent of sound when the room is not full. B.B.C.
studios used for plays or news talks should have zero reverberation
time, as clarity is all-important, and the studios are built from special
plaster or cork panels which absorb the sound completely. The structure
of a room also affects the acoustics. Rooms with large curved surfaces
tend to focus echoes at certain places, which is unpleasant aurally to the

audience, and a huge curtain was formerly hung from the roof of the
Albert Hall to obscure the dome at orchestral concerts.
Refraction

Sound waves can be refracted as well as reflected. Tyndall placed
a watch in front of a balloon filled with carbon dioxide, which is heavier
than air, and found that the sound was heard at a definite place on the
other side of the balloon. The sound waves thus converged to a focus on
the other side of the balloon, which therefore has the same effect on
sound waves as a convex lens has on light waves (see Fig. 28.12, p. 684).
If the balloon is filled with hydrogen, which is fighter than air, the
sound waves diverge on passing through the balloon. The latter thus
acts similarly to a concave lens when light waves are incident on it
(see p. 683).

refraction of sound explains why sounds are easier to hear at
during day-time. In the latter case the upper layers of air
than
night
are colder than the layers near the earth. Now sound travels faster the
higher the temperature (see 624), and sound waves are hence refracted
in a direction away from the earth. The intensity of the sound waves thus
diminish. At night-time, however, the layers of air near the earth are
colder than those higher up, and hence sound waves are now refracted
towards the earth, with a consequent increase in intensity.

For a similar reason, a distant observer O hears a sound from a source

him, Fig. 26.6. When the wind is blowing towards O, the bottom of the

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

is moving slower than the upper part, and hence the
wavefronts veer towards the observer, who therefore hears the sound
easily. When the wind is blowing in the opposite direction the reverse
is the case, and the wavefronts veer upwards away from the ground and
O. The sound intensity thus diminishes. This phenomenon is hence
another example of the refraction of sound.

Interference of

Sound Waves

Besides reflection and refraction, sound waves can also exhibit the

phenomenon of interference, whose principles we

now discuss.

Suppose two sources of sound, A, B, have exactly the same frequency

phase with each other, Fig. 26.7. Such sources are called "coherent"

is known as the Principle of Superposition. Thus their resultant effect

wave travelled in the opposite direction SBE; and since these waves

B, of the tube can be pulled out, thus

making SAE, SBE of different lengths. When SAE and SBE are equal
in length an observer at E hears a loud sound, since the paths of the
two waves are then equal. As B is pulled out the sound dies away and
becomes a minimum when the path difference, SBE — SAE, is A/2,
where A is the wavelength. In this case the two waves arrive 180° out
of phase (p. 617). If the tube is pulled out farther, the sound increases
in loudness to a maximum; the path difference is then A. If k is the
distance moved from one position of minimum sound,
say, to the
next position of minimum sound, PQ say, then 2k

The velocity of sound in the tube is given by V /A, where /is the

tube, the tube B was moved a distance 4-28 cm between successive
minima of sound, and the frequency of the source was 4000 Hz.

Velocity of Sound in Free Air. Hebb's

Method

In 1905 Hebb performed an accurate experiment to measure the
which utilised a method of interference. He
carried out his experiment in a large hall to eliminate the effect of
wind, and obtained the temperature of the air by placing thermometers
at different parts of the room. Two parabolic reflectors, Rlt R2 , are
placed at each end of the hall, and microphones,
x,
2 , are positioned
at the respective foci, S x , S 2 to receive sound reflected from Rx , R a

A source of sound of known constant frequency is placed at the

and microphone maintained at its focus S^ Rx is moved along its axis in
one direction. The positions of Rj are noted when minima of sound are
heard; and since the distance between successive minima corresponds
to one wavelength, A, the velocity of sound can be calculated from the
relation V — /A, as /and A are known.
Other Velocity of Sound Determinations

sound in air has been determined by many scientists.
accurate determinations was carried out in 1738 by
French scientists, who observed the time between the flash and the
hearing of a cannon report about 30 km away. Their results confirmed that the velocity of sound increased as the temperature of the
air increased (p. 624), and they obtained the result of 362 metres per
second for the velocity at 0° C. Similar experiments were carried out by
French scientists in 1822. In 1844 experiments carried out in the Tyrol
district, several thousand metres above sea-level, showed that the

The

the

sound was independent of the pressure of the air (p. 624).
Regnault, the eminent French experimental scientist of the nineteenth century, carried out an accurate series of measurements on the
velocity of sound in 1864. Guns were fired at one place, breaking an
electrical circuit automatically, and the arrival of the sound at a distant
place was recorded by a second electrical circuit. Both circuits actuated
a pen or style pressing against a drum rotating at a steady speed round
its axis, which is known as a chronograph. Thus marks were made on
the drum at the instant the sound occurred and the instant it was received.
The small interval corresponding to the distance between the marks
was determined from a wavy trace made on the drum by a style attached
to an electrically-maintained tuning-fork whose frequency was known,
and the speed of sound was thus calculated.
The velocity of sound in water was first accurately determined in
1826. The experiment was carried out by immersing a bell in the Lake
of Geneva, and arranging to fire gunpowder at the instant the bell was

struck. Miles away, the interval was recorded between the flash and
the later arrival of the sound in the water, and the velocity was then
calculated. This and other experiments have shown that the velocity in

objection to all these methods of determining velocity is the
unknown time lag between the receipt of the sound by an observer and
his recording of the sound. The observer has, as it were, a "personal
equation" which must be taken into account to determine the true time
of travel of the sound. In Hebb's method, however, which utilises

Consider a layer of air some distance away from two pure notes of

Beat Frequency Formula

Suppose two sounding tuning-forks have frequencies fyf2 cycles per
second close to each other. At some instant of time the displacement of
a particular layer of air near the ear due to each fork will be a maximum
to the right. The resultant displacement is then a maximum, and a loud
sound or beat is heard. After this, the vibrations of air due to each fork
go out of phase, and t seconds later the displacement due to each fork
is again a maximum to the right, so that a loud sound or beat is heard
again. One fork has then made exactly one cycle more than the other.

To decide which value of fx is correct, the end of the tuning-fork
prong is loaded with a small piece of plasticine, which diminishes the
frequency a little, and the two notes are sounded again. If the beats
are increased, a little thought indicates that the frequency of the note
must have been originally 996 Hz. If the beats are decreased, the frequency of the note must have been originally 1004 Hz. The tuningfork must not be overloaded, as the frequency may decrease, if it was
1004 Hz, to a frequency such as 995 Hz, in which case the significance
of the beats can be wrongly interpreted.
Beats are also used to "tune" an instrument to a given note. As the
instrument note approaches the given note, beats are heard, and the
instrument can be regarded as "tuned" when the beats are occurring
at a very slow rate.

Effect of Pressure and Temperature on Velocity of Sound in a

But pv — mRT, where R is the gas constant for unit mass of the gas

Since y and R are constants for a given gas, it follows that the velocity
of sound in a gas is independent of the pressure if the temperature remains
constant. This has been verified by experiments which showed that the
velocity of sound at the top of a mountain is about the same as at the
bottom, p. 619. It also follows from (i) that the velocity of sound is proportional to the square root of its absolute temperature. Thus if the

Ultrasonics

There are sound waves of higher frequency than 20000 Hz, which are
inaudible to a human being. These are known as ultrasonics; and since
wavelength x frequency, ultrasonics have short wavevelocity
lengths compared with sound waves in the audio-frequency range.
In recent years ultrasonics have been utilised for a variety of industrial
purposes. They are used on board coasting vessels for depth sounding,
the time taken by the wave to reach the bottom of the sea from the
surface and back being determined. Ultrasonics are also used to kill
bacteria in liquids, and they are used extensively to locate faults and
cracks in metal castings, following a method similar to that of radar.
Ultrasonic waves are sent into the metal under investigation, and the
beam reflected from the fault is picked up on a cathode-ray tube screen
together-with the reflection from the other end of the metal. The position
of the fault can then easily be located.

=

Production of Ultrasonics

In 1881 Curie discovered that a thin plate of quartz increased or
decreased in length if an electrical battery was connected to its opposite
faces. By correctly cutting the plate, the expansion or contraction could
be made to occur along the axis of the faces to which the battery was
applied. When an alternating voltage of ultrasonic frequency was
connected to the faces of such a crystal the faces vibrated at the same
frequency, and thus ultrasonic sound waves were produced.

Another method of producing ultrasonics is to place an iron or nickel
rod inside a solenoid carrying an alternating current of ultrasonic
frequency. Since the length of a magnetic specimen increases slightly
when it is magnetised, ultrasonic sound waves are produced by the
vibrations of the rod.

Doppler Effect

The whistle of a train or a jet aeroplane appears to increase in pitch
as it approaches a stationary observer; as the moving object passes the
observer, the pitch changes and becomes lowered. The apparent alteration in frequency was first predicted by Doppler in 1845, who stated
that a change of frequency of the wave-motion should be observed when
a source of sound or light was moving, and it is accordingly known as

the Doppler

effect.

Fig. 26.13. Doppler

effect.

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

628

The Doppler effect occurs whenever there is a relative velocity between
the source of sound or light and an observer. In light, this effect was
observed when measurements were taken of the wavelength of the
colour of a moving star; they showed a marked variation. la sound,
the Doppler effect can be demonstrated by placing a whistle in the end
of a long piece of rubber tubing, and whirling the tube in a horizontal
circle above the head while blowing the whistle. The open end of the
tube acts as a moving source of sound, and an observer hears a rise
and fall in pitch as the end approaches and recedes from him.
complete calculation of the apparent frequency in particular cases
is given shortly, but Fig. 26.13 illustrates how the change of wavelengths,
and hence frequency, occurs when a source of sound is moving towards
a stationary observer. At a certain instant the position of the moving
source is at 4. At four successive seconds before this instant the source

A

had been

at the positions 3, 2, 1,
respectively. If V is the velocity of
sound, the wavefront from the source when in the position 3 reaches
the surface
of a sphere of radius V and centre 3 when the source is
just at 4. In the same way, the wavefront from the source when it was
in the position 2 reaches the surface B of a sphere of radius 2V and
centre 2. The wavefront C corresponds to the source when it was in the
position 1, and the wavefront
to the source when it was in the position
O. Thus if the observer is on the right of the source S, he receives wavefronts which are relatively more crowded together than if S were
stationary; the frequency of S thus appears to increase. When the
observer is on the left of S, in which case the source is moving away
from him, the wavefronts are farther apart than if S were stationary,
and hence the observer receives correspondingly fewer waves per
second. The apparent frequency is thus lowered.

Doppler's Principle in Light

measurements of the wavelengths of the spectrum lines which they
emit. Suppose a star or planet is moving with a velocity v away from
the earth and emits light of wavelength A. If the frequency of the vibrations is / cycles per second, then / waves are emitted in one second,
where c=fX and c is the velocity of light in vacuo. Owing to the velocity
v, the /waves occupy a distance (c
v). Thus the apparent wavelength

and the difference in the wavelengths, X' — X, is measured. From (i),

present in the star. If the former are displaced towards the red, the
star is receding from the earth; if it is displaced towards the violet, the
star is approaching the earth. By this method the velocities of the stars
have been found to be between about 10 km s _1 and 300 km s _1 . The
Doppler effect has also been used to measure the speed of rotation of
the sun. Photographs are taken of the east and west edges of the sun;
each contains absorption lines due to elements such as iron vaporised
in the sun, and also some absorption lines due to oxygen in the earth's
atmosphere. When the two photographs are put together so that the
oxygen lines coincide, the iron lines in the two photographs are displaced relative to each other. In one case the edge of the sun approaches
the earth, and in the other the opposite edge recedes from the earth.
Measurements show a rotational speed of about 2 km s -1

Measurement of Plasma Temperature
In very hot gases or plasma, used in thermonuclear fusion experiments,
the temperature is of the order of millions of degrees Celsius. At these
high temperatures molecules of the glowing gas are moving away and
towards the observer with very high speeds and, owing to the Doppler
effect, the wavelength A of a particular spectral line is apparently
changed. One edge of the line now corresponds to an apparently increased

wavelength At due to molecules moving directly towards the observer,
and the other edge to an apparent decreased wavelength A2 due to
molecules moving directly away from the observer. The line is thus
observed to be broadened.

Nodes and Antinodes
We have now sufficient information to deduce the conditions of the
layers of air along
when a stationary wave is obtained. From the
curves showing the resultant displacement, S, in Fig. 27.3, it can be
seen that some layers, marked N, are permanently at rest; these
are known as nodes. The layers marked A, however, are vibrating
through an amplitude twice as big as the incident or reflected waves,
see Fig. 27.3 (ii) and (iv), and these are known as antinodes. Layers
between consecutive nodes are vibrating in phase with each other, but
the amplitude of vibration varies from zero at a node N to a maximum

Differences Between Plane-Progressive and Stationary

Waves

At the beginning of Chapter 25, we considered in detail the planewave and its effect on the medium (pp. 584 and 587). It
was then shown that each layer vibrates with constant amplitude at
the same frequency, and that each layer is out of phase with others
near to it. When a stationary wave is present in a medium, however,
some layers (nodes) are permanently at rest; others between the nodes

The particle velocity in a stationary wave is the rate of change of the
displacement (y) of the particle with respect to time (t). The velocity at
the nodes is always zero since the particles there are permanently at rest.
The velocity at an antinode increases from zero (when the particle is
at the end of its oscillation) to a maximum (when the particle passes
through its mean or original position). The corresponding displacement

Suppose that curve 1 represents the displacements at the antinodes
and other points at an instant when they are a maximum, Fig. 27.6 (i).

The layer of air immediately to the left of the node at a is then displaced
towards a, since the displacement is positive from curve 1, and the layer
immediately to the right of a also displaced towards a. The air at a is
thus compressed, and the pressure is thus greater than normal, as represented by curve 1 in Fig. 27.6 (ii). The displacements of the layers on

an antinode of the stationary wave. In a plane-progressive wave, however,
the pressure variation is the same at every point in a medium (p. 585).

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

The pressure variation in a sounding pipe has been examined by
means of a sensitive flame, designed by Lord Rayleigh. The length of
the flame can be made sensitive to the pressure of the gas supplied, so
that if the pressure changes the length of flame is considerably affected.
Several of the flames can be arranged at different parts of the pipe,
with a thin rubber or mica diaphragm in the pipe, such as at B, C,
Fig. 27.11 (ii). At a place of maximum pressure variation,
which is a
node (p. 645), the length of flame alters accordingly. At a place of
constant (normal) pressure, which is an antinode, the length of flame
remains constant.

The pressure variation at different parts of a sounding pipe can also
be examined by using a suitable small microphone at B, C, instead of
a flame. The microphone is coupled to a cathode-ray tube and a wave
of maximum amplitude is shown on the screen when the pressure
variation is a maximum. At a place of constant (normal) pressure, no
wave is observed on the screen.
End-correction of Pipes

The air at the open end of a pipe is free to move, and hence the vibraend of a sounding pipe extend a little into the air outside
the pipe. The antinode of the stationary wave due to any note is thus
a distance c from the open end in practice, known as the end-correction,
and hence the wavelength A in the case of a closed pipe is given by

mechanical system which is free to move, like a wooden bridge or
the air in pipes, has a natural frequency of vibration,
, which depends
on its dimensions. When a periodic force of a frequency different from

and undergoes forced vibrations. When the periodic force has a frequency equal to the natural frequency/o of the system, the amplitude of
vibration becomes a maximum, and the system is then set into resonance.

Some time ago it was reported in the newspapers that a
soprano who was broadcasting had broken a glass tumbler on the
table of a listener when she had reached a high note. This is an example
of resonance. The glass had a natural frequency equal to that of the
note sung, and was thus set into a vibration sufficiently violent to
break it.
The phenomenon of resonance occurs in other branches of Physics
than Sound and Mechanics. When an electrical circuit containing a
coil and capacitor is "tuned" to receive the radio waves from a distant
transmitter, the frequency of the radio waves is equal to the natural
frequency of the circuit and resonance is therefore obtained.

The effect of damping can be illustrated by attaching a simple pendulum carrying a pith bob, and one of the same length carrying a lead

and it is then seen that the amplitude of the lead bob is much greater
than that of the pith bob. The damping of the pith bob due to air resistance is much greater than for the lead bob.

Modes of Vibration of Stretched

a wire is stretched between two points N,
and is plucked in the
middle, a transverse wave travels along the wire and is reflected at the
fixed end. A stationary wave is thus set up in the wire, and the simplest
mode of vibration is one in which the fixed ends of the wire are nodes,
N, and the middle is an antinode, A, Fig. 27.18. Since the distance beIf

These are known as the "laws of vibration of a fixed string", first completely given by Mersenne in 1636, and the sonometer, or monochord,

hanging down at
the other end. Wooden bridges, B, C, can be placed beneath the wire
so that a definite length of wire is obtained, and the length of wire can
be varied by moving one of the bridges. The length of wire between
B,
can be read from a fixed horizontal scale S, graduated in centimetres, on the box below the wire.
(1) To verify f oc \\lfor a given tension (T) and mass per unit length (m),

until the note obtained by plucking BC in the middle is the same as
that produced by a sounding tuning-fork of known frequency /. If
the observer lacks a musical ear, the "tuning" can be recognised by
listening for beats when the wire and the tuning-fork are both sounding,
as in this case the frequencies of the two notes are nearly equal (p. 620).
Alternatively, a small piece of paper in the form of an inverted V can
be placed on the middle of the wire, and the end of the sounding tuningfork then placed on the sonometer box. The vibrations of the fork are
then transmitted through the box to the wire, which vibrates in
resonance with the fork if its length is "tuned" to the note. The paper
will then vibrate considerably and may be thrown off the wire.
Different tuning-forks of known frequency / are taken, and the
lengths, /, of the wire are observed when they are tuned to the corresponding note.

Measurement of the Frequency of A.C. Mains

The frequency of the alternating current (A.C.) mains can be determined with the aid of a sonometer wire. The alternating current is
passed into the wire MP, and the poles N, S of a powerful magnet are
placed on either side of the wire so that the magnetic field due to it is
perpendicular to the wire, Fig. 27.25. As a result of the magnetic effect of
the current, a force acts on the wire which is perpendicular to the
directions of both the magnetic field and the current, and hence the wire
is subjected to a tranverse force. If the current is an alternating one of
50 Hz, the magnitude of the force varies at the rate of 50 Hz. By
adjusting the tension in the sonometer wire, whose magnitude is read on
the spring-balance A, a position can be reached when the wire is seen to
be vibrating through a large amplitude in this case the wire is resonating

maintained under a tension of value 4 kgf and an alternating current is
passed through the wire. A horse-shoe magnet is placed with its poles above

resonant vibration. If the density of the material of the wire is 8800 kg m-3

VIBRATIONS IN RODS
Sound waves travel through liquids and solids, as well as through
and in the nineteenth century an experiment to measure the
velocity of sound in iron was carried out by tapping one end of a very
long iron tube. The speed of sound in iron is much greater than in air,
and the sound through the iron thus arrived at the other end of the
gases,

pipe before the sound transmitted through the air. From a knowledge
of the interval between the sounds, the length of the pipe, and the
velocity of sound in air, the velocity of sound in iron was determined.
More accurate methods were soon forthcoming for the velocity of sound
in substances such as iron, wood, and glass, and they depend mainly on
the formation of stationary waves in rods of these materials.

the entire length, Fig. 27.27.
rod AE, clamped at its mid-point, is

rod is stroked at A by a rosined cloth in the direction EA, the rod vibrates
longitudinally and a high-pitched note can be heard. The end E acts as a
vibrating source of the same frequency, and a sound wave thus travels
through the air in T and is reflected at the fixed end R. If the rod is
moved so that the position of E alters, a position can be found when
the stationary wave in the air in T causes the lycopodium powder to

become

violently agitated. The powder then settles into definite small
heaps at the nodes, which are the positions of permanent rest of the
stationary wave, and the distance between consecutive nodes can best
be found by measuring the distance between several of them and dividing
by the appropriate number.

finding the ratio y, of its specific heats. It was then discovered that
y
was about 1-65, showing that argon was a monatomic gas. The dissociation of the molecules of a gas at high temperatures has been investigated by containing it in Kundt's tube surrounded by a furnace, and
measuring the magnitude of y when the temperature was changed.

Wave

theory of light

Historical

It has already been mentioned that light is a form of energy which
stimulates our sense of vision. One of the early theories of light, about
400 B.C., suggested that particles were emitted from the eye when an
object was seen. It was realised, however, that something is entering the
eye when a sense of vision is caused, and about 1660 the great Newton
proposed that particles, or corpuscles, were emitted from a luminous
object. The corpuscular theory of light was adopted by many scientists
of the day owing to the authority of Newton, but Huygens, an
eminent Dutch scientist, proposed about 1680 that light energy travelled
from one place to another by means of a wave-motion. If the wave theory
of light was correct, light should bend round a corner, just as sound
travels round a corner. The experimental evidence for the wave theory
in Huygens' time was very small, and the theory was dropped for more

Young obtained evidence

than a century. In 1801, however, Thomas
that light could produce wave effects (p. 688),

and he was among the
sound and light waves. As
the principles of the subject became understood other experiments were
carried out which showed that light could spread round corners, and
Huygens' wave-theory of light was revived. Newton's corpuscular
theory was rejected since it was incompatible with experimental observations (see p. 679), and the wave theory of light has played, and is still
playing, an important part in the development of the subject.
first

to see clearly the close analogy between

In 1905 the great mathematical physicist Einstein suggested that the
energy in light could be carried from place to place by particles whose
energy depended on the wavelength of the light. This was a return to a
corpuscular theory, though it was completely different from that of
Newton, as we see later. Experiments carried out at his suggestion showed
that the theory was true, and the particles of light energy are known
as "photons" (p. 1080). It is now considered that either the wave theory
or the particle theory of light can be used in a problem on light, depending
on the circumstances of the problem. In this book we shall first consider
Huygens' wave theory, which was the foundation of many notable
advances in the subject.

Consider a point source of light, S, in air, and suppose that a disturbance, or wave, originates at S as a result of vibrations occurring
inside the atoms of the source, and travels outwards. After a time t the

wave has travelled a distance ct, where c is the velocity of light in air,
and the light energy has thus reached the surface of a sphere of centre
S and radius ct, Fig. 28. 1 The surface of the sphere is called the wavefront
of the light at this instant, and every point on it is vibrating "in step"
or in phase with every other point. As time goes on the wave travels
further and new wavefronts are obtained which are the surfaces of spheres

At points a long way from S, such as C or D, the wavefronts are
portions of a sphere of very large radius, and the wavefronts are then
substantially plane. Light from the sun reaches the earth in plane wavefronts because the sun is so far away; plane wavefronts also emerge
from a convex lens when a point source of light is placed at its focus.
The significance of the wavefront, then, is that it shows how the light

considered, it is the surface of a sphere of centre S.
In this simple example of obtaining the new wavefront, the light
travels in the same medium. Huygens' construction, however, is
especially valuable for deducing the new wavefront when the light
travels from one medium to another, as we shall soon show.

Prior to the wave theory of light, Newton had proposed a corpuscular
or particle theory of light. According to Newton, particles are emitted

by a source of light, and they travel in a straight line until the boundary
of a new medium is encountered.
In the case of reflection at a plane surface Newton stated that at some
',

very small distance from the surface M, represented by AB, the particles
were acted upon by a repulsive force, which gradually diminished the
component of the velocity v in the direction of the normal and then
reversed it, Fig. 28.6. The horizon tal component of the velocity remained

and hence the velocity of light (v) in water is less than the velocity (c) in

that the corpuscular theory, as enunciated by Newton, could not be
true (p. 559).

INTERFERENCE OF LIGHT

The

beautiful colours seen in thin films of oil in the road, or in soap
bubbles, are due to a phenomenon in light called interference. Newton
discovered that circular coloured rings were obtained when white light
illuminated a convex lens of large radius of curvature placed on a sheet

of plane glass (p. 693), which is another example of interference. As we
saw in Sound, interference can be used to measure the wavelength of
sound waves (p. 617). By a similar method the phenomenon can be used
to measure the wavelengths of different colours of light. Interference of
light has also many applications in industry.
The essential conditions, and features, of interference phenomena
have already been discussed in connection with sound waves. As there
is an exact analogy between the interference of sound and light waves we
can do no better than recapitulate here the results already obtained

on pp. 616-617:
1. Permanent interference between two sources of light can only take
place if they are coherent sources, i.e., they must have the same frequency
and be always in phase with each other or have a constant phase difference. (This implies that the two sources of light must have the same
colour.)

the coherent monochromatic light sources are P, Q, a bright
observed at B if the path-difference, QB PB, is a whole number
of wavelengths, Fig. 29.1. (This corresponds to the case of a loud sound

very close to each other as the wavelength of light is very small, otherwise the bright and dark pattern in front of the sources tend to be too
fine to see and no interference pattern is obtained.
One of the first demonstrations of the interference of light waves
was given by Young in 1801. He placed a source, S, of monochromatic
light in front of a narrow slit C, and arranged two very narrow slits

A, B, close to each other, in front of C. Much to his delight, Young
observed bright and dark bands on either side of O on a screen T, where

O is on the perpendicular bisector of AB, Fig. 29.2.

Fig. 29.2. Young's experiment.

Young's observations can be explained by considering the light from
S illuminating the two slits A, B. Since the light diverging from A has
exactly the same frequency as, and is always in phase with, the light

A

and B act as two close coherent sources. Interdiverging from B,
ference thus takes place in the shaded region, where the light beams

Measurement of Wavelength by Young's Interference Bands

A

laboratory experiment to measure wavelength by Young's interference bands is shown in Fig. 29.4. Light from a small filament lamp is

focused by a lens on to a narrow

slit S, such as that in the collimator of a
spectrometer. Two narrow slits A, B, about a millimetre apart, are
placed a short distance in front of S, and the light coming from A, B is

about two metres
away. Some coloured interference bands are then observed by M. A red
and then a blue filter, F, placed in front of the slits, produces red and then
blue bands. Observation shows that the separation of the red bands is
more than that of the blue bands. Now A ayID, from (ii), where v is the
separation of the bands. It follows that the wavelength of red light is
longer than that of blue light.
An approximate value of the wavelength of red or blue light can be
found by placing a Perspex rule R in front of the eyepiece and moving it
until the graduations are clearly seen, Fig. 29.4. The average distance,
y, between the bands is then measured on R. The distance a between

The wavelength A can then be calculated from A

order 6 x 10~ 5 cm. Further details of the experiment can be obtained
from Advanced Level Practical Physics by Nelkon and Ogborn (Heinemann).
The wavelengths of the extreme colours of the visible spectrum vary
with the observer. This may be 4 x 10 -5 cm for violet and 7 x 10 -5
cm for red; an "average" value for visible light is 5-5 x 10 -5 cm,
which is a wavelength in the green.

5. If white light is used the central band is white, and the bands either
side are coloured. Blue is the colour nearer to the central band and red
is farther away. The path difference to a point O on the perpendicular
bisector of the two slits A, B is zero for all colours, and consequently
each colour produces a bright band here. As they overlap, a white band
is formed. Farther away from O, in a direction parallel to the slits, the

emerging after refraction from the two halves, L, Q, of the
prism can be considered to come from two sources, A, B, which are the
virtual images of the slit S in L, Q respectively. Thus A, B are coherent
sources; further, as R has a very large obtuse angle, A and B are close
together. Thus an interference pattern is
observed in the region of O where the
emergent light from the two sources overlap, as shown by the shaded portion of
Fig. 29.5, and bright and dark bands can
be seen through an eyepiece E at O directed
towards R, Fig. 29.6. By using cross- wires,

Interference in Thin

Wedge Films

A very thin wedge of an air film can be formed by placing a thin piece
of foil or paper between two microscope slides at one end Y, with the
slides in contact at the other end X, Fig. 29.7. The wedge has then a very
small angle 0, as shown. When the air-film is illuminated by monochromatic light from an extended source S, straight bright and dark
bands are observed which are parallel to the line of intersection X of
the two slides.

S

N^Vir-film^^

Fig. 29.7. Thin wedge film.

The light reflecte4 down towards the wedge is partially reflected
upwards from the lower surface O of the top slide. The remainder of the
light passes through the slide and some is reflected upward from the top
surface B of the lower slide. The two trains of waves are coherent, since
both have originated from the same centre of disturbance at O, and
they produce an interference phenomenon if brought together by the
eye or in an eyepiece. Their path difference is It, where t is the small
thickness of the air-film at O. At X, where the path difference is apparently
zero, we would expect a bright band. But a dark band is observed at X.
This is due to a phase change of 180°, equivalent to an extra path difference of A/2, which occurs when a wave is reflected at a denser medium.
See pp. 641, 694. The optical path difference between the two coherent
beams is thus actually 2/ -f A/2, and hence, if the beams are brought
A/2 = m A, or
together to interfere, a bright band is obtained when It
It = (m — J) A. A dark band is obtained at a thickness t given by 2t = m A.
The bands are located at the air-wedge film, and the eye or microscope
must be focused here to see them. The appearance of a band is the
contour of all points in the air-wedge film where the optical path difference is the same. If the wedge surfaces make perfect optical contact at
one edge, the bands are straight lines parallel to the line of intersection of
the surfaces. If the glass surfaces are uneven, and the contact at one edge
is not regular, the bands are not perfectly straight. A particular band

is formed between the plates, the optical path
becomes 2nt, where the air thickness is t, n being the refractive
index of the liquid. An optical path difference of A now occurs for a
change in t which is n times less than in the case of the air- wedge. The
spacing of the bright and dark bands is thus n times closer than for air,
and measurement of the relative spacing enables n to be found.
The coefficient of expansion of a crystal can be found by forming an
air-wedge of small angle between a fixed horizontal glass plate and the
upper surface of the crystal, and illuminating the wedge by monochromatic light. When the crystal is heated a number of bright bands,
m say, cross the field of view in a microscope focused on the air-wedge.
The increase in length of the crystal in an upward direction is m A/2, since
a change of A represents a change in the thickness of the film is A/2,
and the coefficient of expansion can then be calculated.

coloured, generally with violet at the inner and red at the outer edge.

hence white light is obtained. The list is known generally as "Newton's
scale of colours". Newton left a detailed description of the colours
obtained with different thicknesses of air.
When Newton's rings are formed by sodium light, close examination
shows that the clarity, or visibility, of the rings gradually diminishes as
one moves outwards from the central spot, after which the visibility
improves again. The variation in clarity is due to the fact that sodium
light is not monochromatic but consists of two wavelengths, A2 A ,

It may be noted here that the bands in films of varying thickness,
such as Newton's rings and the air-wedge bands, p. 692, appear to be
formed in the film itself, and the eye must be focused on the film to
see them. We say that the bands are "localised" at the film. With a
thin film of uniform thickness, however, bands are formed by parallel

rays which enter the eye,

and these bands are therefore

localised at

infinity.

Lloyd's Mirror

plane mirror M, and illuminating it with light nearly at grazing incidence,

coming from a slit O parallel to the mirror, Fig. 29.12. A point such as
A on the screen is illuminated (i) by a ray OA and (li) by a ray
reflected along MA, which appears to come from the virtual image I
of O in the mirror. Since O and I are close coherent sources interference
bands are obtained on the screen.
Experiment showed that the band at N, which corresponds to the
point of intersection of the mirror and the screen, was dark; since
ON = IN, this band might have been expected, before the experiment
was carried out, to be bright. Lloyd concluded that a phase change of
180°, equivalent to half a wavelength, occurred by reflection at the
mirror surface, which is a denser surface than air (see p. 692).

Interference in Thin Films

The colours observed in a soap-bubble or a thin film of oil in the

thin transparent films of glass.

Colours in Thin Films

The colours in thin films of oil or glass are due to interference from
an extended source such as the sky or a cloud. Fig. 29.14 illustrates interference between rays from points O t O a respectively on the extended
source. Each ray is reflected and refracted at A1} A 2 on the film, and
enter the eye at Ex Although O x

the same colour of a particular wavelength A if 2 nt cos r = (m — £) A.
The separation of the two rays from A t or from A 2 must be less than the
diameter of the eye-pupil for interference to occur, and this is the case
only for thin films. The angle of refraction r is determined by the angle

of incidence, or reflection, at the film. The particular colour seen thus
depends on the position of the eye. At E 2 for example, a different colour
will be seen from another point O a on the extended source. The variation
of 6 and hence r is small when the eye observes a particular area of the
film, and hence a band of a particular colour, such as Aj A 2 is the con,

tour of paths of equal inclination to the film. The bands are localised at
infinity, since the rays reaching Ej or E 2 are parallel.
If a thin wedge-shaped film is illuminated by an extended source, as
shown on p. 692 or in Newton's rings, the bands seen are contours of
equal thickness of the film.

An

Soap Film Colours

on thin films, due to C. V. Boys, can be
performed by illuminating a vertical soap film with monochromatic
light. At first the film appears uniformly coloured. As the soap drains
to the bottom, however, a wedge-shaped film of liquid forms in the
ring, the top of the film being thinner than the bottom. The thickness
of the wedge is constant in a horizontal direction, and thus horizontal
bright and dark bands are observed across the film. When the upper
part of the film becomes extremely thin a black band is observed at the
top (compare the dark central spot in Newton's rings experiment), and
the film breaks shortly afterwards.
With white light, a succession of broad coloured bands is first
observed in the soap film. Each band contains colours of the spectrum,
red to violet. The bands widen as the film drains, and just before it
breaks a black band is obtained at the top.
For normal incidence of white light, a particular wavelength A is
seen where the optical path difference due to the film
(m — £) A and
m is an integer. Thus a red colour of wavelength 7-0 X 10~ 5 cm is seen
where the optical path difference is 3-5 x 10~ 5 cm, corresponding to
m \. No other colour is seen at this part of the thin film. Suppose,
however, that another part of the film is much thicker and the optical
path difference here is 21 X 3-5 x 10~ 5 cm. Then a red colour of wavelength 70 x 10 -5 cm, m

The experiment was one of a number which showed that

We have seen how interference patterns, for example, bright and dark
bands, can be obtained with the aid
of two sources of light close to each
other. These sources must be coherent sources, i.e., they must have
the same amplitude and frequency,

If a source of white light is observed through the eyelashes, a series
of coloured images can be seen. These images are due to interference
between sources on the same wavefront, and the phenomenon is thus an
example of diffraction. Another example of diffraction was unwittingly
deduced by Poissqn at a time when the wave theory was new. Poisson
considered mathematically the combined effect of the wavefronts round
a circular disc illuminated by a distant small source of light, and he came
to the conclusion that the light should be visible beyond the disc in
the middle of the geometrical shadow. Poisson thought this was impossible; but experiment confirmed his deduction, and he became a
supporter of the wave theory of light. See Fig. 29.17.

Each point on the same wavefront between A, B acts as a secondary
centre of disturbance, and sends out wavelets beyond the slit. All the
secondary centres are coherent, and their combined effect at any point

from the Principle of Superposition. The mathematical treatment is
beyond the scope of this book. The general effect, however, can be derived
by considering the two halves AC, CB of the wavefront AB. At a point
P equidistant from A and B, corresponding secondary centres in AC,
CB respectively, such as X and Y, are also equidistant from P. Consequently wavelets arrive in phase at P. When AB is of the order of a
few wavelengths of light £he resultant amplitude at P due to the whole

wavefront

AB is therefore large, and thus a bright band is obtained at P.

As we move from P

parallel to AB, points are obtained where the
secondary wavelets from the two halves of the wavefront become more
and more out of phase on arrival and the brightness thus diminishes.
Consider a point Q, where AQ is half a wavelength longer than CQ.
A disturbance from A, and one from C, then arrive at Q 180° out of
phase. This is also practically the case for all corresponding points such
as X, Y on the two halves of the wavefront. In particular, CQ and BQ
differ practically by A/2, where C is the extreme point in the upper half
of the wavefront and B is the extreme point on the lower half. Thus Q
corresponds to the edge or minimum intensity of the central band

These results are true for any wave phenomenon. In the case of an

spread round corners or apertures such as a doorway, which have

can then just be distinguished or resolved. Lord Rayleigh stated a
criterion for the resolution of two objects, which is generally accepted:
Two objects are just resolved when the maximum intensity of the central
pattern of one object falls on the first minimum or dark edge of the other.
Fig. 29.22 (i) shows the two stars just resolved. The resultant intensity
in the middle dips to about 0-8 of the maximum, and the eye is apparently sensitive to the change here. Fig. 29.22 (ii) shows two stars S 1? S 2

The angular distance 9 between two distant stars just resolved is thus
given by sin 9

This is an expression for the limit of resolution, or resolving power, of a
telescope. The limit of resolution or resolving power increases when 9
is smaller, as two stars closer together can then be resolved. Consequently telescope objectives of large diameter
give high resolving
power. The Yerkes Observatory has a large telescope objective of about
100 cm. The angular distance 9 between two stars which can just be

Brightness of Images in Telescope

In a telescope, the eye is placed at the exit-pupil or eye-ring, the circle
through which the emergent beam passes (p. 532). The entrance pupil of
the telescope is the aperture or diameter of the objective. If the area of
the latter is A, then the smaller area of the exit-pupil is AjM\ where
is the angular magnification of the telescope in normal adjustment (see

M

p. 535).

INTERFERENCE, DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT

Consider a telescope used to observe (a) a small but finite area, or
extended object, and (b) a point source, such as a star. Suppose that in
each case the magnifying power is adjusted to make the exit pupil of the
telescope equal to the eye pupil. In each case the luminous flux collected
with the telescope is equal to the flux collected by an unaided eye multi2
plied by the ratio area of objective/area of eye-pupil, which is

when
the retinal image of the finite object is magnified by a factor
the telescope is used. On the other hand, since the eye-pupil is filled with
light by the telescope, the retinal image of the point object with the
telescope is the same as that "without the telescope—it is the diffraction
image for a point source. It will be seen that, for the finite object, the
larger flux is spread over a larger image area, so that (apart from absorption losses in the telescope) the retinal illumination is unchanged. For
the point object, however, the increased flux is spread over the same
retinal area so that the brightness of the image is increased. On this
account stars appear very much brighter when viewed by a telescope,
whereas the brightness of the background, which acts as an extended
object, remains about the same. Stars too faint to be seen with the
naked eye become visible using a powerful telescope, and the number
of stars seen thus increases considerably using a telescope.

Diffraction Grating

On p. 703 we saw that the image of a single narrow rectangular slit is
a bright central or principal maximum diffraction band, together with
subsidiary maxima diffraction bands which are much less bright. Suppose that parallel light is incident on two more parallel close slits, and
the light passing through the slits is received by a telescope focused at
infinity. Since each slit produces a similar diffraction effect in the same
direction, the observed diffraction pattern will have an intensity variation identical to that of a single slit. This time, however, the pattern is
crossed by a number of interference bands, which are due to interference
between slits (see Young's experiment, p. 688). The envelope of the
intensity variation of the interference bands follow the diffraction pattern variation due to a single slit. In general, if 78 is the intensity at a
point due to interference and Id that due to diffraction, then the resultant

Measurement of Wavelength

The wavelength of monochromatic
diffraction grating in conjunction with

light can be measured by a
a spectrometer. The collimator

C and telescope T of the instrument are first adjusted for parallel light
and the grating P is then placed on the table so that its plane is
perpendicular to two screws, Q, R, Fig. 29.26 (i). To level the table so that
the plane of P is parallel to the axis of rotation of the telescope, the latter
is first placed in the position Tx directly opposite the illuminated slit
of the collimator, and then rotated exactly through 90° to a position T2
The table is now turned until the slit is seen in T 2 by reflection at P, and
one of the screws Q,
turned until the slit image is in the middle of the
field of view. The plane of P is now parallel to the axis of rotation of the
telescope. The table is then turned through 45° so that the plane of the
grating is exactly perpendicular to the fight from C, and the telescope
is turned to a position T 3 to receive the first diffraction image,
Fig. 29.26 (ii). If the lines of the grating are not parallel to the axis of
rotation of the telescope, the image will not be in the middle of the field
of view. The third screw is then adjusted until the image is central.

Spectra in Grating
If white light is incident normally on a diffraction grating, several
coloured spectra are observed on either side of the normal, Fig. 29.28 (i).
The first order diffraction images are given by d sin
A, and as violet
has a shorter wavelength than red, 6 is less for violet than for red.
Consequently the spectrum colours on either side of the incident white
light are violet to red. In the case of a spectrum produced by dispersion
in a glass prism, the colours range from red, the least deviated, to violet,
Fig. 29.28 (ii). Second and higher order spectra are obtained with a diffraction grating on opposite sides of the normal, whereas only one spectrum
is obtained with a glass prism. The angular spacing of the colours is also

shows that for a given angle of incidence and diffraction, it is the total
width Ndofthe grating which determines its resolving power. The number

of rulings in that width affects the dispersion in a given order but has
effect on the resolving power in that order. Thus a grating of 5 cm
width and 6000 lines per cm has twice the resolving power of a
grating 2-5 cm wide which also has 6000 lines per cm. If a grating

diffraction grating. In this case the

structure appears uniformly bright and unrecognisable if only the
zero order image is collected by the microscope objective. If, in addition,
the first order diffraction image is collected, the image plane in the
objective contains alternate bright and dark strips or fringes in positions
corresponding to images of the grating elements. The observer then
recognises the grating structure, that is, the grating is "resolved". The
more orders collected by the objective, the closer does the intensity distribution across the image plane resemble that transmitted by the
object itself. The effect is analogous to the recognition of a note from a
violin in Sound. This consists of a fundamental of the same frequency,
together with overtones of higher frequency which gives the sound its
timbre or quality. If only the fundamental is received, the note will
not be recognisable as the note from the violin. The more overtones
received in addition to the fundamental, the more faithful is the reproduction of the note.
An expression for the resolving power of a microscope can now be
obtained. We require, for resolution, that a first order diffraction image
is collected in addition to the zero order. Suppose that an object of
regular structure is illuminated at an angle of incidence i by an oblique
beam (Fig. 29.30). Then, if the first order image is just collected by the

rays which cause chemical action (ultra-violet rays, p. 456). As these rays
are all due to electric and magnetic vibrations they are examples
of electromagnetic waves (see p. 719). Scientists have measured the

wavelengths of these waves by a diffraction grating method, and results
show a gradual transition in the magnitudes of the wavelength from one

We

have shown that light is a wave-motion of some kind, i.e., that
a travelling vibration. For a long time after the wave-theory was
revived it was thought that the vibrations of light occurred in the same
direction as the light wave travelled, analogous to sound waves. Thus
light waves were thought to be longitudinal waves (p. 584). Observations and experiments, however, to be described shortly, showed that
the vibrations of light occur in planes perpendicular to the direction along
which the light wave travels, and thus light waves are transverse waves.

about the direction of propagation, because a slit C allows the wave to
pass through when it is parallel to B, but prevents it from passing when

perpendicular to those shown between B and C in Fig. 29.32 (i).

with its plane parallel to P, the emergent light becomes darker and

This simple experiment leads to the conclusion that light waves are
transverse waves; otherwise the light emerging from Q could never be
extinguished by simply rotating this crystal. The experiment, in fact,
is analogous to that illustrated in Fig. 29.32, where transverse waves were
set up along a rope and plane-polarised waves were obtained by means
of a slit B. Tourmaline is a crystal which, because of its internal molecular

the "vibrations of light", and the planes containing the vibrations shown in

Polarised Light by Reflection

The production of polarised light by tourmaline is due to selective
absorption of the "ordinary" rays. In 1808 Malus discovered that
polarised light is obtained when ordinary light is reflected by a plane
sheet of glass (p. 719). The most suitable angle of incidence is about
56°, Fig. 29.37. If the reflected light is viewed through a tourmaline
crystal which is slowly rotated about the line of vision, the light is

one position of the crystal. This proves that
by the glass is plane-polarised. Malus also showed
that the light reflected by water is plane-polarised.
The production of the polarised light by the glass is explained as
follows. Each of the vibrations of the incident (ordinary) light can be
resolved into a component parallel to the glass surface and a component perpendicular to the surface. The light due to the components

A pile

ofplates increases the percentage, and thus provides a simple method of
producing plane-polarised light. They are mounted inclined in a tube so
that the ordinary (unpolarised) light is incident at the polarising angle,
and the transmitted light it then fairly plane-polarised.
Polarisation by Doable Refraction

We have already considered two methods of producing polarised light.
The first observation of polarised light, however, was made by Bartholinus in 1669, who placed a crystal of iceland spar on some words on a
sheet of paper. To his surprise, two images were seen through the crystal.

See Fig. 29.38.
Iceland spar is a crystalline form of calcite (calcium carbonate) which
cleaves in the form of a "rhomboid" when it is lightly tapped; this is a
solid whose opposite faces are parallelograms. When a beam of unpolarised light is incident on one face of the crystal, its internal molecular structure produces two beams of polarised light, E, O, whose vibrations are
perpendicular to each other, Fig. 29.39. If the incident direction AB is
parallel to a plane known as the "principal section" of the crystal, one

beam O emerges parallel to AB, while the other beam E emerges displaced
in a different direction. As the crystal is rotated about the line of vision the
beam E revolves round O. On account of this abnormal behaviour the
rays in E are called "extraordinary" rays; the rays in O are known as
"ordinary" rays (p. 719). Thus two images of a word on a paper, for
example, are seen when an Iceland spar crystal is placed on top of it; one
image is due to the ordinary rays, while the other is due to the extraordinary rays.
With the aid of an Iceland spar crystal Malus discovered the polarisation of light by reflection (p. 719). While on a visit to Paris he gazed

diagonal AB, and the halves are cemented together by a layer of Canada
balsam, Fig 29. 40. The refractive index of the crystal for the ordinary
rays is 1 -66, and is 1 -49 for the extraordinary rays; the refractive index of
the Canada balsam is about 1 -55 for both rays, since Canada balsam does
not produce polarised light. critical angle thus exists between the crystal

balsam if the angle of incidence is large enough, as it is with the Nicol

polarised.

Differences Between Light and

Sound Waves

We are now in a position to distinguish fully between light and sound
waves. The physical difference, of course, is that light waves are due to
varying electric and magnetic forces, while sound waves are due to
vibrating layers or particles of the medium concerned. Light can travel
through a vacuum, but sound cannot travel through a vacuum. Another
very important difference is that the vibrations of the particles in sound
waves are in the same direction as that along which the sound travels,
whereas the vibrations in light waves are perpendicular to the direction
along which the light travels. Sound waves are therefore longitudinal
waves, whereas light waves are transverse waves. As we have seen, sound

waves can be reflected and refracted, and can give rise to interference
phenomena; but no polarisation phenomena can be obtained with sound
waves since they are longitudinal waves, unlike the case of light waves.

In the course of his experiments du Fay also discovered that there

amber tended to oppose one another's attractiveness. To illustrate how
he did so, we may use ebonite instead of amber, which has the same
electrical properties. We suspend a pith-ball, and attract it with an
electrified ebonite rod E (Fig. 30.1(i)) we then bring an electrified glass
rod G towards the ebonite rod, and the pith-ball falls away (Fig. 30.1(ii)).
Benjamin Franklin, a pioneer of electrostatics, gave the name of
'positive electricity' to the charge on a glass rod rubbed with silk, and
'negative electricity' to that on an ebonite rod rubbed with fur.

Electrons and Electrostatics

Towards the end of the nineteenth century Sir J. J. Thomson discovered the existence of the electron (p. 1002). This is the lightest particle
known—it is about l/1840th of the mass of the hydrogen atom and
experiments show that it carries a tiny quantity of negative electricity.
Later experiments showed that electrons are present in all atoms.
The detailed structure of atoms is complicated, but, generally,
electrons exist round a minute core or nucleus carrying positive
electricity. Normally, atoms are electrically neutral, that is, there is
no surplus of charge on them. Consequently the total negative charge
on the electrons is equal to the positive charge on the nucleus. In
insulators, all the electrons appear to be firmly 'bound' to the nucleus
under the attraction of the unlike charges. In metals, however, some
of the electrons appear to be relatively 'free'. These electrons play an
important part in electrical phenomena concerning metals.
The theory of electrons (negatively charged particles) gives simple
explanations of electrification by friction, and of the attraction of
uncharged bodies by charged ones. If the silk on which a glass rod has
been rubbed is brought near to a charged and suspended ebonite rod
it repels it
the silk must therefore have a negative charge. We know
that the glass has a positive charge, and therefore we suppose that

were transferred from the glass to the silk. Likewise we suppose that
when fur and ebonite are rubbed together, electrons go from the fur
to the ebonite.

Attraction of Charged

for

Uncharged Bodies

To explain the attraction of a charged body for an uncharged one,
we shall suppose that the uncharged body is a conductor a metal. If

charge on the rod repels the free electrons in the metal to its remote
end (Fig. 30.2). A positive charge is thus left on the near end of the
metal this, being nearer than the negative charge on the far end, is
attracted more strongly than the negative charge is repelled. On the

a conductor, the mechanism by which it is attracted is more complicated we shall postpone its description to a later chapter.

Electrostatics

Today

The discovery of

the electron has led, in the last twenty or thirty

importance of electrostatics.
In devices such as radio valves and cathode-ray tubes, for example,
electrons are moving under the influence of electrostatic forces. The
problems of preventing sparks and the breakdown of insulators are
essentially electrostatic. There are also difficulties in making measurements at very high voltages. These problems occur in high-voltage
electrical engineering. Later, we shall also describe a modern electrostatic generator, of the type used to provide a million volts or more for
X-ray work and nuclear bombardment. Such generators work on
principles of electrostatics discovered over a hundred years ago.

charges consisted of a metal rod A to which gold leaves L were

and was insulated with a plug P from a metal case C which screened
L from outside influences other than those brought near to B.
When B is touched by an ebonite rod rubbed with fur, some of the
negative charge on the rod passes to the cap and L; and since like
charges repel, the leaves diverge (Fig. 30.4(i)). If an unknown charge X
is now brought near to B, an increased divergence implies that X is

near to A. The spheres are now separated, and then the rod is taken
away. Tests with a charged pith-ball now show that A has a positive
charge and B a negative charge (Fig. 30.5(ii)). If the spheres are placed
together so that they touch, it is found that they now have no effect on
a pith-ball held near. Their charges must therefore have neutralized
each other completely, thus showing that the induced positive and
negative charges are equal. This is explained by the movement of
electrons from A to B when the rod is brought near. B has then a
negative charge and A an equal positive charge.

charge; the charge left, called the induced charge, has always the
opposite sign to the inducing charge.

Fig. 30.6. Charging permanently by induction.

This phenomenon of induction can again be explained by the movement of electrons. If the inducing charge is negative, then, when we
touch the conductor, electrons are repelled from it to earth, as shown
in Fig. 30.6(ii), and a positive charge is left on the conductor. If the
inducing charge is positive, then the electrons are attracted up from the
earth to the conductor, which then becomes negatively charged.

Induction and the Electroscope
It is

always observed that the leaves of an electroscope diverge

when a charged body is brought near its cap, without touching it.
This we can now easily understand if, for example, we bring a negatively charged rod near the cap, it induces a positive charge on the
cap, and a negative one on the leaves the leaves then repel each other.
Further, the negative charge on the leaves induces a positive one on the

The Electrophorus

A device which provides an almost unlimited supply of charge,
by induction, was invented by Volta about 1800; it is called an
electrophorus. It consists of an ebonite or perspex base, E in Fig. 30.8,
and a metal disc D on an insulating handle. The ebonite is charged negatively by rubbing it
or, much better, beating it
with fur. The disc
is then laid upon it, and acquires induced charges, positive underneath
and negative on top, (i). Very little negative charge escapes from the

—

—

ebonite to the disc, because the natural unevenness of their surfaces
prevents them touching at more than a few points ; charge escapes from
these points only, because the ebonite is a non-conductor. After it has
been placed on the ebonite, the disc is earthed with the finger, and the
negative charge on its upper surface flows away, (ii). The disc can then
be removed, and carries with it the positive charge which was on its
underside, (iii).

again repeatedly, until the charge on the ebonite has disappeared by
leakage. Apparently, therefore, it is in principle an inexhaustible source
of energy. However, work is done in raising the disc from the ebonite,
against the attraction of their opposite charges, and this work must be
done each time the disc is charged; the electrophorus is therefore not
a source of energy, but a device for converting it from a mechanical
into an electrical form.
The action of the electrophorus illustrates the advantages of charging
by induction. First, the supply of charge is almost inexhaustible,
because the original charge is not carried away. Second, a great charge
—nearly equal to the charge on the whole of the ebonite can be
concentrated on to the conducting disc. As we have seen, only a very
small charge could be transferred by contact, because the ebonite is
not a conductor.

ELECTROSTATICS

The Action of Points, Van de Graaff Generator
Sometimes in experiments with an electroscope connected to other
apparatus by a wire, the leaves of the electroscope gradually collapse,
as though its charge were leaking away. This behaviour can often be
traced to a sharp point on the wire if the point is blunted, the leakage
stops. Charge leaks away from a sharp point through the air, being
carried by molecules away from the point. This is explained later

lower part of the belt with positive
charge, which is carried up into the

with negative charge, and discharges it before it passes over the pulley.
The sphere gradually charges up positively, until its potential is about
a million volts relative to the earth.
Large machines of this type are used with high- voltage X-ray tubes,
and for atom-splitting experiments. They have more elaborate electrode systems, stand about 15
high, and have 4

can produce potential differences up to 5 000 000 volts and currents of
about 50 microamperes. The electrical energy which they deliver
comes from the work done by the motor in drawing the positively
charges belt towards the positively charged sphere, which repels it.
In all types of high-voltage equipment sharp corners and edges must
be avoided, except where points are deliberately used as electrodes.
Otherwise, corona discharges may break out from the sharp places. All
such places are therefore enlarged by metal globes, these are called
stress-distributors. See also p. 749.

Ice-pail

Experiment

A famous experiment on electrostatic induction was made by Faraday
in 1843. In it he used the ice-pail from which it takes its name; but it
was a modest pail, 27 cm high not a bucket. He stood the pail on an
insulator, and connected it to a gold-leaf electroscope, as in Fig. 30.1 l(i).
He next held a metal ball on the end of a long silk thread, and charged it
positively by a spark from an eleclrophorus. Then he lowered the ball
into the pail, without letting it touch the sides or bottom (Fig. 30.1 l(ii)).

A positive charge was induced on the outside of the pail and the leaves,
and made the leaves diverge. Once the ball was well inside the pail,
Faraday found that the divergence of the leaves did not change when
he moved the ball about nearer to or farther from the walls or the
bottom. This showed that the amount of the induced positive charge
did not depend on the position of the ball, once it was well inside the
pail. Faraday then allowed the ball to touch the pail, and noticed that

—

the leaves of the electrocope still did not move (Fig. 30.1 l(iii)). When the
ball touched the pail, therefore, no charge was given to, or taken from,
the outside of the pail. Faraday next lifted the ball out of the pail, and
tested

it

for charge with another electroscope.

He found

that the ball

had no charge whatever (Fig. 30.1 l(iv)). The induced negative charge on
the inside of the pail, must therefore have been equal in magnitude to
the original positive charge on the ball.

(i) When a charged body is enclosed in a hollow conductor it induces
on the inside of that conductor a charge equal but opposite to its own
and on the outside a charge equal and similar to its own (Fig. 30.1 l(i)).
(n) The total charge inside a hollow conductor is always zero either
there are equal and opposite charges on the inside walls and within the
volume (before the ball touches), or there is no charge at all (after the

Comparison and Collection of Charges
Faraday's ice-pail experiment gives us a method of comparing quanof electric charges. The experiment shows that if a charged body
is lowered well inside a tall, narrow can then it gives to the outside of
the can a charge equal to its own. If the can is connected to the cap
of an electroscope, the divergence of the leaves is a measure of the
charge on the body. Thus we can compare the magnitudes of charges,
without removing them from the bodies which carry them we merely
lower those bodies, in turn, into a tall insulated can, connected to an

electroscope

Sometimes we may wish to discharge a conductor completely, without letting its charge run to earth. We can do this by letting the conductor touch the bottom of a tall can on an insulating stand. The
whole of the body's charge is then transferred to the outside of the can.
Charges Produced by Separation ; Lines of Force

The ice-pail experiment suggests that a positive electric charge, for
example, is always accompanied by an equal negative charge. Faraday

induced on the inner and outer walls ©I each (Fig. 30.13).
Faraday also showed that equal and opposite charges are produced
when a body if electrified by rubbing. He fitted an ebonite rod with a
fur cap, which he rotated by a silk thread or string wrapped round it
(Fig. 30.14(i)); he then compared the charges produced with an icepail and electroscope (Fig. 30. 1 4(i) (ii) (iii) (i v) ).
In describing the conclusions from this last experiment, we now say,
as indeed we have done already, that electrons flow from the fur to the

and electroscope by touching one of them, and repeat the observation
with a proof-plane fitting a different part of the body. Since the proofplanes have equal areas, each of them carries away a charge proportional
to the charge per unit area of the body, over the region which it touched.
The charge per unit area over a region of the body is called the surfacedensity of the charge in that region. We find that the surface-density
increases with the curvature of the body, as shown in Fig. 30.17(iii) the
distance of the dotted line from the outline of the body is proportional
to the surface-density of charge.

The magnitude of the force between two electrically charged bodies

small compared with the distance between them, then the force F was
inversely proportional to the square of the distance

This result is known as the inverse square law, or Coulomb's law.
It is not possible to verify the law accurately by direct measurement
of the force between two charged bodies. In 1936 Plimton and Lawton

So far we have considered charges in a vacuum. If charges are situated
media such as water, then the force between the charges is
reduced. Equation (4) is true only in a vacuum. In general, we write
in other

where e is the permittivity of the medium. The permittivity of air at
normal pressure is only about 1005 times that, e of a vacuum. For
most purposes, therefore, we may assume the value of g for the

permittivity of air. The permittivity of water is about eighty times
that of a vacuum. Thus the force between charges situated in water is
eighty times less than if they were situated the same distance apart
in a

On p. 742 we saw that the surface-density of charge (charge per unit

strength of the electric field near the point is very great. The intense

of charged molecules away from the point. The mechanism of. the

Let us consider two points A and B in an electrostatic field, and let
us suppose that the force on a positive charge Q has a component / in
the direction AB (Fig. 30.23 (ii)). Then if we move a positively charged
body from B to A, we do work against this component of the field E.
We define the potential difference between A and B as the work done in
moving a unit positive chargefrom B to A. We denote it by the symbol VAB
The work done will be measured in joules (J). The unit of potential
difference is called the volt and may be defined as follows The potential
difference between two points A and B is one volt if the work done in
taking one coulomb of positive charge from B to A is one joule.
From this definition, if a charge of Q coulombs is moved through a
p.d. of Fvolt, then the work done Win joules is given by

as usual by VAh If we take a positive charge Q from B to
it of amount
AB the charge gains this amount of
potential energy. If we now let the charge go back from A to B, it
loses that potential energy work is done on it by the electrostatic force,
in the same way as work is done on a falling stone by gravity. This
work may become kinetic energy, if the charge moves freely, or external
work if the charge is attached to some machine, or a mixture of the two.
The work which we must do in first taking
the charge from B to A does not depend on
the path along which we carry it, just as the
work done in climbing a hill does not depend
on the route we take. If this were not true,
we could devise a perpetual motion machine,
in which we did less work in carrying a
charge from B to A via X than it did for us
in returning from A to B via Y (Fig. 30.24).
'°
The fact that the potential differences
between two points is a constant, independent
of the path chosen between the points, is the most important property
of potential in general ; we shall see why later on. This property can be
conveniently expressed by saying that the work done in carrying a
charge round a closed path in an electrostatic field, such as BXAYB

Zero Potential
Instead of speaking continually of potential differences between pairs
of points, we may speak of the potential at a single point provided we
always refer it to some other, agreed, reference point. This procedure
is analogous to referring the heights of mountains to sea-level.
For practical purposes we generally choose as our reference point the
electric potential of the surface of the earth. Although the earth is
large it is all at the same potential, because it is a good conductor of
electricity if one point on it were at a higher potential than another,
electrons would flow from the lower to the higher potential. As a result,

(p. 1026); it is analogous to the latent heat of evaporation of a liquid.

EQUIPOTENTIALS

already said that the earth must have the same potential

differences of potential, because these would set up a potential gradient

positive or negative, or whether it is uncharged it is true whatever the
actual potential of the conductor, relative to any other body.
Any surface or volume over which
the potential is constant is called
an equipotential. The volume or
surface may be that of a material
body, or simply a surface or volume
in space. For example, as we shall

they have no direction they do not point north, east, south, or west.
Quantities which have direction, like forces, are called 'vectors'; they
have to be added either by resolution into components, or by the
parallelogram method. Either way is slow and clumsy, compared with
the addition of scalars. For example, we can draw the equipotentials
round a point-charge with compasses if we draw two sets of them, as
in Fig. 30.33 (i) or (ii), then by simple addition we can rapidly sketch
the equipotentials around the two charges together.
And when we have plotted the equipotentials, they turn out to be
more useful than lines of force. A line of force diagram appeals to the
imagination, and helps us to see what would happen to a charge in
the field. But it tells us little about the strength of the field at the
best, if it is more carefully drawn than most, we can only say that
the field is strongest where the lines are closest. But equipotentials can

spacing we can find the actual value of the potential gradient, and
hence the field-strength. The only difficulty in interpreting equipotential diagrams lies in visualizing the direction of the force on a
charge this is always at right angles to the curves.

Potential of Pear-shaped Conductor

On p. 742 we saw that the surface-density of the charge on a pearshaped conductor was greatest where the curvature was greatest. The
potential of the conductor at various points can be examined by means
of the gold-leaf electroscope, the case being earthed. One end of a wire
is connected to the cap
some of the wire is then wrapped round an
insulating rod, and the free end of the wire is placed on the conductor.
As the free end is moved over the conductor, it is observed that the
divergence of the leaf remains constant. This result was explained

surround the charges with a Faraday cage, and connect the cage to
earth (Fig. 30.36). The charge induced on the outside of the cage then
runs to earth, and there is no external field. (When a cage is used to
shield something inside it, it does not have to be earthed.)

ELECTROSTATICS
Comparison of Static and Current Phenomena

Broadly speaking, we may say that in electrostatic phenomena we
meet small quantities of charge, but great differences of potential. On
the other hand in the phenomena of current electricity discussed later,
the potential differences are small but the amounts of charge transported
by the currents are great. Sparks and shocks are common in electrostatics, because they require great potential differences but they are
;

amount of energy available is
usually small. On the other hand, shocks and sparks in current electricity
are rare, but, when the potential difference is great enough to cause
rarely dangerous, because the total

them, they are likely to be dangerous.

These quantitative differences make problems of insulation much

more difficult in electrostatic apparatus than in apparatus for use with
currents. The high potentials met in electrostatics make leakage
currents relatively great, and the small charges therefore tend to
disappear rapidly. Any wood, for example, ranks as an insulator for
current electricity, but a conductor in electrostatics. In electrostatic
experiments we sometimes wish to connect a charged body to earth
all we have then to do is to touch it.

Capacitors

A

capacitor (or 'condenser'), is a device for storing electricity. The
was invented almost accidentally by van Musschenbroek of Leyden, in about 1746, and became known as a Leyden
jar. A present-day form of it is shown in Fig. 31.1 (i), J is a glass jar,
FF are tin-foil coatings over the lower parts of its walls, and T is
a knob connected to the inner coating. Modern forms of capacitor are
shown at (ii) and (iv) in the figure. Essentially, all capacitors consist
of two metal plates separated by an insulator. The insulator is called
the dielectric; in some capacitors it is oil or air. Fig. 31.1 (iii) shows the
conventional symbol for a capacitor.

Charging a Capacitor

To study the action of a capacitor we need a paper one of about
4 microfarad capacitance (see later), a couple of high-tension batteries
D and a high impedance voltmeter V such as a valve voltmeter reading
to about 300 volts. We also need a two-way key (K in Fig. 31.2) and a
poor conductor (R). The latter is a short stick of powdered and compressed carbon it is called a radio resistor, and should have a resistance
of about 5 megohms (p. 790). We connect the batteries in series, and
measure their total voltage, V with the voltmeter (Fig. 31.2 (i)). We
then connect up all the apparatus as shown in Fig. 31.2 (ii). If we close

Charging and Discharging Processes

When we connect a capacitor to a battery, electrons flow from the
negative terminal of the battery on to the plate A of the capacitor

(Fig. 31.3); and, at the same
flow from the other plate B of
the capacitor towards the positive terminal of
+the battery. Positive and negative charges thus
appear on the plates, and oppose the flow of
electrons which causes them. As the charges
accumulate, the potential difference between the
plates increases, and the charging current falls
to zero when the potential difference becomes
equal to the battery voltage V
When the battery is disconnected and the
plates are joined together by a wire, electrons
flow back from plate A to plate B until the Fig. 31.3. A capacitor

Capacitors in A.C. Circuits

Capacitors are widely used in alternating current and radio circuits,
because they can transmit alternating currents. To see how they do
so, let us consider the circuit of Fig. 31.4, in which the capacitor may
be connected across either of the batteries X, Y. When the key is
closed at A, current flows from the battery X, and charges the plate

When Q is in coulombs (C) and V is in volts (V), then capacitance C is in
farads (F). One farad (IF) is the capacitance of an extremely large
capacitor. In practical circuits, such as in radio receivers, the capacitance
of capacitors used are therefore expressed in microfarads (juF). One

Factors determining Capacitance. Variable Capacitor

We shall now find out by experiment what factors influence capacitance.

To

we

This shows that, when a capacitor is given a fixed charge, the potential
difference between its plates is inversely proportional to its capacitance.

Dielectric

Fig. 31.6. Factors determining capacitance.

We set the plates close together, but not touching, and charge A from
an electrophorus. The leaves of the electroscope diverge by an amount
which measures the potential difference between the plates. If we move
the plates further apart the leaves diverge further, showing that the
potential difference has increased (Fig. 31.6(ii)). Since we have done
nothing to increase the charge on the plates, the increase in potential
difference must be due to a decrease in capacitance (see above equation).

The capacitance of a capacitor therefore decreases when the separation
of its plates is increased we shall see in the next chapter that the

is

inversely proportional to the separation.

Dielectric. Let us now put a dielectric
a sheet of glass or ebonite
between the plates. The leaves diverge less, showing that the potential
difference has decreased (Fig. 31.6 (iii)). The capacitance has therefore
increased, and the increase is due to the dielectric. By using several
sheets of it we can show that the effect of the dielectric increases with

thickness. In practical capacitors the dielectric completely fills the
space between the plates.
Area of plates. To see how the capacitance depends on the area of
the plates, we set them at a known distance apart. We then take
another pair of plates, at the same distance apart, and connect them
to the first pair by wires held on insulating handles (Fig. 31.6 (iv)). The
leaves diverge less, showing that the capacitance has increased it is,
in fact, directly proportional to the area of the plates.

A capacitor in which the effective area of
the plates can be adjusted is called a variable
capacitor. In the type shown in Fig. 31.7,
the plates are semicircular and one set can be
swung

into or out of the other. The capacitance is proportional to the area of overlap
of the plates. The plates are made of brass

Dielectric Constant (Relative Permittivity) and Strength

To study the effect of the dielectric in a capacitor, the capacitance
of a given capacitor must be measured first without a dielectric, and
then with one. We shall see later how this can be done (p. 776):
:

The

ratio of the capacitance with

called the dielectric constant (or relative permittivity) of the

material used. The expression 'without a dielectric' strictly means
'with the plates in a vacuum'; but the effect of air on the capacitance
of a capacitor is so small that for most purposes it may be neglected.
The dielectric constant of a substance is denoted by the letter £ thus

dielectric constant is the ratio of the permittivity of the
substance to that of free space. It is for this reason that dielectric

constant is a pure number and has no dimensions, unlike s or £
The following table gives the value of dielectric constant, and also
of dielectric strength, for various substances. The strength of a dielectric
is the potential gradient at which its insulation breaks down, and
a spark passes through it. A solid dielectric is ruined by such a breakdown, but a liquid or gaseous one heals up as soon as the applied
potential difference is reduced.

in his day.

We regard a molecule as a collection of atomic nuclei, positively charged, and
surrounded by a cloud of negative electrons. When a dielectric is in a charged
capacitor, its molecules are in an electric field; the nuclei are urged in the direction
of the field, and the electrons in the opposite direction (Fig 31.10 (i)). Thus each
molecule is distorted, or polarized: one end has an excess of positive charge, the
other an excess of negative. At the surfaces of the dielectric, therefore, charges
appear, as shown in Fig 31.10 (ii). These charges are of opposite sign to the charges
on the plates, and so reduce the potential difference between the plates.

permanently polarized: they are called polar

For example, the water molecule consists of an oxygen atom, O, with
two hydrogen atoms H, making roughly a right-angled structure (Fig. 31.11 (i)).
Oxygen has a nuclear charge of + 8e, where e is the electronic charge, and has
eight electrons. Hydrogen has a nuclear charge of +e, and one electron. In the
water molecule, the two electrons from the hydrogen atom move in paths which
surround the oxygen nucleus. Thus they are partly added to the oxygen atom,
and partly withdrawn from the hydrogen atoms. On the average, therefore, the
apex of the triangle is negatively charged, and its base is positively charged. In
an electric field, water molecules tend to orient themselves as shown in Fig. 31.11 (ii).
The effect of this, in a capacitor, is to increase the capacitance in the way already
described The increase is, in fact, much greater than that obtained with a dielectric which is polarized merely by the action of the field.

Energy of a Charged Capacitor

A charged capacitor is a store of electrical energy, as we may see
from the vigorous spark it can give on discharge. To find the energy
stored, let us suppose that the capacitor, of capacitance C, is already
charged to a potential difference V. And let us suppose that we wish
to increase the charge on its plates from Q to Q + SQ, where SQ is very
small. Then we must transfer a charge SQ from the negative plate to the
positive. In doing so, we shall increase the potential difference by the
amount

sv-f
But if SQ is very small compared with Q, SV will be very small compared
V, and the potential difference will be almost constant at the
value V. Then the work done in displacing the charge SQ will be

In 1786 Galvani, while dissecting a frog, noticed that its leg-muscle
twitched when one of his assistants produced an electric spark in
another part of the room. He also found that, when a frog's legmuscle was hung by a copper hook from an iron stand, the muscle
twitched whenever it swung so as to touch the stand. Galvani supposed
that the electricity which caused the twitching was generated within
the muscle, but his fellow-Italian Volta believed that it arose from the
contact of the two different metals. Volta turned out to be right, and

1799 he discovered how to obtain from two metals a continuous
supply of electricity: he placed a piece of cloth soaked in brine between
copper and zinc plates (Fig. 32.1 (i)). The arrangement is called a
voltaic cell, and the metal plates its 'poles'; the copper is known as the
positive pole, the zinc as the negative cell. Volta increased the power
by building a pile of cells, with the zinc of one cell resting on the copper
of the other (Fig. 32.1 (ii)). From this pile he obtained sparks and shocks
similar to those given by electrostatic machines.
Shortly after, it was found that water was decomposed into hydrogen
and oxygen when connected to a voltaic pile. This was the earliest
discovery of the chemical effect of an electric current. The heating

by supposing, naturally, that the thermocouples and galvano-

meter, as well as the wire, offered resistance to the current. He interpreted the constant / as the length of wire equal in resistance to the
galvanometer and thermocouples. The ohm, symbol Q, is the unit of
electrical resistance (see p. 790).

Mechanism of Metallic Conduction
The conduction of electricity in metals is due to free electrons.
Free electrons have thermal energy, and wander randomly through the

metal from atom to atom.

787

When a battery is connected across the ends

of the metal, an electric field

is set

up.

The electrons are now accelerated

by the field, so they gain velocity and energy. When they 'collide' with
an atom vibrating about its fixed mean position (called a 'lattice site'),
they give up some of their energy to it. The amplitude of the vibrations
is then increased and the temperature of the metal rises. The electrons
are then again accelerated by the field and again give up some energy.
Although their movement is erratic, on the average the electrons drift
in the direction of the field with a mean speed we calculate shortly.
This drift constitutes an 'electric current'. It will be noted that heat is
generated by the collision of electrons whichever way they flow. Thus
the heating effect of a current called Joule heating (p. 790) is
irreversible, that is, it still occurs when the current in a wire is reversed.
A simple calculation enables the average drift speed to be estimated.

HEAT AND POWER
Electrical Heating. Joule's

Laws

In 1841 Joule studied the heating effect of an electric current by
passing it through a coil of wire in a jar of water (Fig. 32.5). He used
various currents, measured by an early form of galvanometer G, and
various lengths of wire, but always the same mass of water. The rise
in temperature of the water, in a given time, was then proportional
to the heat developed by the current in that time. Joule found that the
heat produced in a given time, with a given wire, was proportional to

The formulae for power, P = I 2 R or V /R, is true only when all the
electrical power supplied is dissipated as heat. As we shall see, the
formulae do not hold when part of the electrical energy supplied is

converted into mechanical work, as in a motor, or into chemical energy,
as in an accumulator being charged. A device which converts all the
electrical energy supplied to it into heat is called a 'passive' resistor;
it may be a wire, or a strip of carbon, or a liquid which conducts
electricity but is not decomposed by it. Since the joule (J) is the unit of

Our

picture of a source of current as a constant potential difference
in series with a resistance is over-simplified, but it has brought us to
the point where we can make a definition of e.m.f. which is both

rigorous and intelligible. We shall make it first in terms of charge, later
in terms of current.
In terms of charge: fa device has an electromotive force E, then, in
passing a charge Q round a circuit joined to it, it liberates an amount of
electrical energy equal to QE. If a charge Q is passed through the source
against its e.m.f., then the work done against the e.m.f. is QE. The above
definition of e.m.f. does not depend on any assumptions about the
nature of its source.
If a device of e.m.f. E passes a steady current / for a time t, then the
charge that it circulates is

This shows that the efficiency tends to unity (or 100 per cent) as the

the load resistance is equal to the internal resistance, the efficiency is
50 per cent (See Fig. 32.12 (i).)

in Electrical Circuits

The loading on a dynamo or battery is generally adjusted for high
efficiency, because that means greatest economy. Also, if a large dynamo
were used with a load not much greater than its internal resistance, the
would be so large that the heat generated in the internal
resistance would ruin the machine. With batteries and dynamos,
therefore, the load resistance is made many times greater than the

current

internal resistance.

power output is common in communication
For example, the last transistor in a receiver delivers
electrical power to the loudspeaker, which the speaker converts into
mechanical power as sound-waves (p. 596). Because it converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, and not heat, the loudspeaker is
not a passive resistor, and the simple equations above do not apply to

THE THERMOELECTRIC EFFECT
Seebeck Effect

The heating effect of the current converts electrical energy into heat,
but we have not so far described any mechanism which converts heat
into electrical energy. This was discovered by Seebeck in 1822 In his
experiments he connected a plate of bismuth between copper wires
leading to a galvanometer, as shown in Fig. 32.14 (i). He found that if

one of the bismuth-copper junctions was heated, while the other was
kept cool, then a current flowed through the galvanometer. The direction of the current was from the copper to the bismuth at the cold
junction. We can easily repeat Seebeck's experiment, using copper and
iron wires and a galvanometer capable of indicating a few microamperes (p. 882) (Fig. 32.14 (ii)).
Thermocouples

Seebeck went on to show that a current flowed, without a battery,
any circuit containing two different metals, with their two junctions

Currents obtained in

are called

thermo-electric currents, and a pair of metals, with their junctions at
different temperatures, are said to form a thermocouple. The following

a list of metals, such that if any two of them form a thermocouple,
then the current will flow from the higher to the lower in the list, across
the cold junction

is

Antimony, Iron, Zinc, Lead, Copper, Platinum, Bismuth.
Thermo-electric currents often appear when they are not wanted;
they may arise from small differences in purity of two samples of the
same metal, and from small differences of temperature due, perhaps,
to the warmth of the hand. They can cause a great deal of trouble in
circuits used for precise measurements, or for detecting other small
currents, not of thermal origin. As sources of electrical energy, thermoelectric currents are neither convenient nor economical, but they have
been used in gas-driven radio sets. Their only wide application is in
the measurement of temperature, and of other quantities, such as

—

—

radiant energy, which can be measured by a temperature

rise.

Variation of Thermoelectric E.M.F. with Temperature

On p. 825 we shall see how thermo-electric e.m.f.s are measured. When
the cold junction of a given thermocouple

is

kept constant at 0°C, and

the hot junction temperature t°C is

Resistance Boxes
In many electrical measurements variable known resistances are
required they are called resistance boxes. As shown in Fig. 33.3 (i) ten
coils, each of resistance 1 ohm, for example, are connected in series.
A rotary switch with eleven contacts enables any number of these coils
to be connected between the terminals AA'. A resistance box contains
several sets of coils and switches, the first giving resistances 0-10 ohms
in steps of 1 ohm, the next 0-100 ohms in steps of 10 ohms, and so on.
;

These are called decade boxes.

The switches used in a decade box are of very high quality; their

in the last twenty years or so: in older boxes no switches are used.
Instead, the resistances are varied by means of plugs. As shown in
Fig. 33.3 (ii), the resistance coils are joined across gaps in a thick brass
bar, and the gaps are formed into tapered sockets to receive shortcircuiting plugs P. The resistance between the terminals A and B in

we shall describe and explain later (p. 924). They are not intended to
carry large currents, and must not be allowed to dissipate more than one
watt Therefore, since P = I 2 R, the greatest safe current for a 1-ohm
coil is 1 amp, and for a 10-ohm coil about 0-3 amp. If the one-watt
limit

is

exceeded, the insulation will be damaged, or the wire burnt out.

The Potential Divider

Two resistance boxes in series are often used in the laboratory to
provide a known fraction of a given potential difference for example,
of one which is too large to measure easily. Fig. 33.4 (i) shows the

resistor with a sliding contact can similarly be used, as shown in
Fig. 33.4 (ii), to provide a continuously variable potential difference, from

zero to the full supply value V This is a convenient way of controlling
the voltage applied to a load, such as a lamp (Fig. 33.4 (iii)). The resistance of the load, R 3, however, acts in parallel with the resistance /^
equation (7) is therefore no longer true, and the voltage V1 must be
measured with a voltmeter. It can be calculated, as in the following
example, if R 3 is known; but if the load is a lamp its resistance varies
greatly with the current through it, because its temperature varies.

MEASURING INSTRUMENTS
Conversion of a Milliammeter into a Voltmeter

Ohm's law enables us to use a milliammeter as a voltmeter. Let us
suppose that we have a moving-coil instrument which requires 5 milliamperes for full-scale deflection (f.s.d.). And let us suppose that the
resistance of its coil, r, is 20 ohms (Fig.
33.6). Then, when it is fully deflected,
the potential difference across

it is

current through it is proportional to the

100 millivolts. Its scale could be engraved as shown at the top of Fig. 33.6.
The potential differences to be measured in the laboratory are
usually greater than 100 millivolts, however. To measure such a
potential difference, we insert a resistor R in series with the coil, as
shown in Fig. 33.7. If we wish to measure up to 10 volts we must
choose the resistance R so that, when 10 volts are applied between the

Conversion of a Milliammeter into an Ammeter

Moving-coil instruments give full-scale deflection for currents smaller
than those generally encountered in the laboratory. If we wish to
measure a current of the order of an ampere or more we connect a low
resistance S, called a shunt, across the terminals of a moving-coil
meter (Fig. 33.9). The shunt diverts most of the current to be measured,
hence its name. Let us suppose that, as before,

The

therefore proportional to the

measured current, as indicated in the figure, and the shunt is said to
have a 'power' of 1000 when used with this instrument.
The resistance of shunts and multipliers are always given with fourfigure accuracy. The moving-coil instrument itself has an error of the
order of 1 per cent.; a similar error in the shunt or multiplier would
therefore double the error in the instrument as a whole. On the other
hand, there is nothing to be gained by making the error in the shunt
less than about 01 per cent, because at that value it is swamped by
the error of the moving system.

Multimeters

A multimeter instrument is one which is adapted for measuring both
current and voltage. It has a shunt R as shown, and a series of voltage
multipliers R' (Fig. 33.10). The shunt is connected permanently across
the coil,

and the

resistances in R' are adjusted to give the desired

Use of Voltmeter and Ammeter

A moving-coil voltmeter is a current-operated instrument. It can be
used to measure potential differences only because the current which it

is

proportional to the potential difference applied to it, from
its action depends on Ohm's law, a moving-coil

law. Since

voltmeter cannot be used in any experiment to demonstrate that law
that is why, when describing such an experiment on p. 789, we specified
measuring instruments whose readings are not dependent on Ohm's
law.

Having once established Ohm's law, however, we can use moving-coil
voltmeters freely; they are both more sensitive and more accurate than
other forms of voltmeters. The current which they take does, however,
sometimes complicate their use. To see how it may do so, let us suppose
that we wish to measure a resistance R of about 100 ohms. As shown
in Fig. 33.12, we connect it in series with a cell, a milliammeter, and a

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

816

reading would then include the potential difference across the
milliammeter. Let us suppose that this is 005 volt when the current
through the milliammeter is 10 mA. Then the potential difference
across the resistor would be 1 volt, and the voltmeter would read
its

105 ohms.

Thus the voltage drop across the milliammeter would make the
resistance appear 5 per cent, higher than

its

true value.

Errors of this kind are negligible only when the voltmeter current is
much less than the current through the resistor, or when the voltage
drop across the ammeter is much less than the potential difference
across the resistor. If we were measuring a resistance of about 1 ohm,
for example, the current /' in Fig. 33.12 would be 1 amp, and / would
be 1002 amp. The error in measuring R would then be only 0-2 per
cent less than the intrinsic error of the meter. But the circuit of
Fig. 33.13 would give the same error as before. It could do so because,
as we saw when considering shunts, the shunt across the milliammeter
would have been chosen to make the voltage drop still 005 volt. Thus
was 1 volt, and the error would be
Vt would still be 105 volt when
5 per cent as before.
In low-resistance circuits, therefore, the voltmeter should be connected as in Fig. 33.12, so that its reading does not include the voltage
drop across the ammeter. But in high-resistance circuits the voltmeter
should be connected as in Fig. 33.13, so that the ammeter does not
carry its current.
If a moving-coil voltmeter is connected across a cell, it will not read
its true e.m.f, because the current which it draws will set up a voltage
drop across the internal resistance of the cell. The drop will be negligible
only if the resistance of the voltmeter is very high compared with the
internal resistance. E.m.f.s are thus compared by a potentiometer

figure of merit of 1000 ohms per volt. Similarly, a voltmeter which
takes 10 mA, or 1/100 amp, for full-scale deflection has a figure of
merit of 100 ohms per volt. The greater the figure of merit of a voltmeter, expressed in this way, the less will it disturb any circuit to which

When a voltmeter of low figure of merit is being used, it may be
necessary to allow for the current which it draws. The allowance is
made in the way indicated on p. 815, where the use of a voltmeter
and ammeter together was discussed.

THE POTENTIOMETER
Pointer instruments are useless for very accurate measurements: the
them have an intrinsic error of abour 1 per cent of full scale.
Where greater accuracy than this is required, elaborate measuring
circuits are used.
One of the most versatile of these, due to Poggendorf, is the potentiometer. It consists of a uniform wire, AB in Fig. 33.13 (i), about a metre
long; through it an accumulator X maintains a steady current /. Since
the wire is uniform, its resistance per centimetre, R, is constant; the
voltage drop across 1 cm of the wire, RI, is therefore also constant.

The potentiometer is more accurate than an electrometer instrument,
which, like a moving-coil voltmeter, has an intrinsic error of about
1 per cent of full-scale. The accuracy of a potentiometer is limited
by the non-uniformity of the slide-wire, the uncertainty of the balancepoint, and the error in measuring the length / of wire from the balancepoint to the end A. With even crude apparatus, the balance-point can
be located to within about 0-5 mm; if the length / is 50 cm, or 500 mm,
then the error in locating the balance-point is 1 1000. If the wire has
been carefully treated, its non-uniformity may introduce an error of
about the same magnitude. The overall error is then about ten times
less than that of a pointer instrument. A refined potentiometer has
a still smaller error.
The precision with which the balance-point of a potentiometer can
be found depends on the sensitivity of the galvanometer the smallness
of the current which will give a just-discernible deflection. A movingcoil galvanometer must be protected by a series resistance R of several
thousand ohms, which is 'shorted out when the balance is nearly reached
(Fig. 33.16). A series resistance is preferable to a shunt, because it re:

It is said to be used as a null-indicator, and the potentiometer method
of measurement, like the bridge methods which we shall describe
shortly, is called a null method.
The current through the potentiometer wire must be steady it must
not change appreciably between the finding of one balance-point and
the next The accumulator which provides it should therefore be
neither freshly charged nor nearly run-down when an accumulator is
in either of those conditions its e.m.f. falls with time. Errors in potentiometer measurements may be caused by non-uniformity of the wire, and
by the resistance of its connexion to the terminal at A. This resistance
is added to the resistance of the length / of the wire between A and the
balance-point, and if it is appreciable it makes equation (11) invalid.

Slide-wire (Metre) Bridge

Fig. 33.33 shows a simple and cheap form of Wheatstone bridge; it is
sometimes called a metre bridge, for no better reason than that the
wire AB is often a metre long. The wire is uniform, as in a potentiometer, and can be explored by a slider S. The unknown resistance
and a known resistance R are connected as shown in the figure; heavy
brass or copper strip is used for the connexions AD, FH, KB, whose
resistances are generally negligible. When the slider is at a point C in

S first on A, then on B. The balance-point is found by trial and error

to indicate when the current in the second part of the experiment
is the same as in the first This principle is very useful in measurements more difficult than that of resistance by direct method For
example, the power output of a small radio transmitter can be measured
by making it light a lamp, which is placed near to a lightmeter (p. 571).
The lamp is then connected to a source of direct current and the
current through it is adjusted until the light-meter gives the same
reading. Simple measurements of the current and the voltage across
the lamp, then give the power supplied to it which is equal to the
power output of the radio transmitter.

We have seen that the resistance of a given wire increases with its
temperature. If we put a coil of fine copper wire into a water bath,

In this chapter we shall deal both with the effects of an electric current

generators of electric current, or cells.

when

ELECTROLYSIS
The chemical

effect of the electric current was first studied quantiby Faraday, who introduced most of the technical terms which
are now used in describing it A conducting solution is called an
electrolyte and the chemical changes which occur when a current passes
through it are called electrolysis (lysis = decomposition). Solutions
in water of acids, bases, and salts are electrolytes, and so are their
solutions in some other solvents, such as alcohoL The plates or wires
which dip into the electrolyte to connect it to the circuit are called
electrodes; the one by which the current enters the solution is called the
anode, and the one by which it leaves is called the cathode (Fig. 34.1 (i)).

The whole arrangement is called a voltameter, presumably because it
can be used to measure the current delivered by a voltaic cell if the
electrolyte is a solution of a copper or silver salt, the voltameter is
called a copper or silver voltameter. If the electrolyte is acidulated
water, then the voltameter is called a water voltameter, because when
a current passes through it, the water, not the acid, is decomposed
;

(Fig. 34.2

We shall see why later.

CHEMICAL EFFECT OF CURRENT
Faraday's

845

Laws of Electrolysis

When a current is passed through copper sulphate solution with
copper electrodes, copper is deposited on the cathode and lost from the
anode. Faraday showed that the mass dissolved off the anode by a
given current in a given time is equal to the mass deposited on the
cathode. He also showed that the mass is proportional to the product
of the current, and the time for which it flows: that is to say, to the
quantity of charge which passes through the voltameter. When he
studied the electrolysis of water, he found that the masses of hydrogen
and oxygen, though not equal, were each proportional to the quantity
of charge that flowed He therefore put forward his first law of electrolysis the mass of any substance liberated in electrolysis is proportional to
:

Faraday's second law of electrolysis concerns the masses of different
substances liberated by the same quantity of charge. An experiment
to illustrate it is in Fig. 34.2 The experiment shows that the masses
of different substances, liberated in electrolysis by the same quantity of
electric charge, are proportional to the ratio of the relative atomic mass
to the valency (also called the chemical equivalent). This is Faraday's
second law; it implies that the same quantity of charge is required to
liberate one mole divided by the valency (also called the 'grammeequivalent') of any substance. Recent measurements give this quantity
as 96500 coulombs; it is called Faraday's constant, symbol F. It is
also known as the faraday.

of a substance which is liberated by one coulomb is called

The Mechanism of Conduction; Ions

The theory of electrolytic conduction is generally attributed to
Arrhenius {J859-1927), although Faraday had stated some of its essentials in 1834. Faraday suggested that the current through an electrolyte was carried by charged particles, which he called ions (Greek

Ionization

attention to how it took place, and the theory of it was given by
Arrhenius in 1887. For a reason which we will consider later, Arrhenius
suggested that an electrolyte ionized as soon as it was dissolved: that
its ions were not produced by the current through it, but were present
as such in the solution, before ever the current was passed.
We now consider that salts of strong bases and acids, such as silver
nitrate, copper sulphate, sodium chloride, ionize completely as soon as
they are dissolved in water. That is to say, a solution contains no
molecules of these salts, but only their ions. Such salts are called strong
electrolytes; so are the acids and bases from which they are formed,

Other salts, such as sodium carbonate, do not appear to ionize
completely on solution in water. They are the salts of weak acids, and
are called weak electrolytes. The weak acids themselves are also
incompletely ionized in water.
Formation of Ions ; Mechanism of Ionization
In the Heat section of this book we described the

structure of the solid state

sodium chloride the structure is made up
of sodium and chlorine ions not of atoms, nor of NaCl molecules, but of Na + and
Cl~ ions. In other words, we think today that ions exist in solid crystalline salts,
as well as in their solutions. We do so for the reason that the idea enables us to
build up a consistent theory of chemical combination, of the solid state, and of

A sodium atom contains eleven electrons, ten of which move in orbits close to
and one of which ranges much more widely for our present purposes
it as in Fig. 34.5 (i). A chlorine atom has ten inner electrons
and seven outer ones; for our present purposes we may lump these into two
groups, as in Fig. 34.5 (ii). The outer electron of the sodium atom is weakly
attracted to its nucleus, but the outer electrons of the chlorine atom are strongly
attracted (because the ten inner electrons are a more effective shield round the
+ 11 nucleus of sodium than round the +17 nucleus of chlorine). Therefore,
when a sodium and a chlorine atom approach one another, the outer electron
of the sodium atom is attracted more strongly by the chlorine nucleus than by
the sodium nucleus. It leaves the sodium atom, and joins the outer electrons of
the nucleus,

by the fact that they ionize in some other solvents as well as water. These solvents
also are liquids which have a high dielectric constant, such as methyl

and

ethyl

however, it seems that strong
electrolytes behave as weak ones do in water only a fraction of the dissolved
molecules, not all of them, dissociate. In the electronic theory of atomic structure,
the chemical behaviour of an element is determined by the number of its outer
electrons. If it can readily lose one or two it is metallic, and forms positive ions
if it can readily gain one or two, it is acidic, and forms negative ions. Ions are not
chemically active in the way that atoms are. Sodium atoms, in the form of a
lump of the metal, react violently with water but the hydroxide which they form

Explanation of Faraday's Laws

The theory of dissociation neatly explains Faraday's laws and some
phenomena of electrolysis. If an AgN0 3 molecule splits up into
Ag + and NOJ ions, then each NOJ ion that reaches the anode
dissolves one silver atom off it. At the same time, one silver atom is
deposited on the cathode. Thus the gain in mass of the cathode is
equal to the loss in mass of the anode. Also the total mass of silver
nitrate in solution is unchanged; experiment shows that this is true.
The mass of silver deposited is proportional to the number of ions
reaching the cathode; if all the ions carry the same charge a reasonable
assumption then the number deposited is proportional to the quantity

Therefore we may say that, each time a silver ion is discharged and
deposited as an atom, a hydrogen ion is also discharged and becomes
an atom. The hydrogen atoms thus formed join up in pairs, and escape
as molecules of hydrogen gas. The theory fits the facts, on the simple
assumption that the hydrogen and silver atoms carry equal charges: we
now say that each is an atom which has lost one electron.
But when we consider the copper voltameter in Fig. 34.6, we find a
complication. For

To

explain this result we must suppose that only one copper atom is
deposited for every two hydrogen atoms liberated. In terms of the
ionic theory, therefore, only one copper ion is discharged for every two
hydrogen ions. It follows that a copper ion must have twice as great
a charge as a hydrogen ion: it must be an atom which has lost two
electrons.

This conclusion

fits

in with

our knowledge of the chemistry of copper.

One atom of copper can replace two of hydrogen, as it does, for example,

therefore suppose that the sulphate ion also is doubly

if we express the charge on an ion in units of the electronic

This assertion, which is illustrated in Fig. 34.7, explains Faraday's
second law (mass deposited oc chemical equivalent). For if a current J
passes through a voltameter for a time t, the total charge carried
through it is It. And if q is the charge on an ion, the number of ions
liberated is It/q. If

and is therefore proportional to M/q. But
is virtually equal to the
relative atomic mass, since the mass of an electron is negligible. And q,
we have just seen, is equal, in electronic units, to the valency. Therefore
the mass liberated is proportional to the ratio of relative atomic mass
to valency. See also p. 845.

Chemists tell us that when 'oxygen and hydrogen combine to form
one mole of water (18 g) then 286 000 joules of heat are evolved. The

When one mole of water is decomposed, this much work must be
done. In the process two moles of hydrogen are liberated (because
the formula for water is H 2 0). The quantity of electricity required to
decompose one mole of water is therefore 2 x 96500 coulombs. If the

which gives rise to the e.m.f. of the cell; it is analogous to the force
exerted by the magnetic field on the moving electrons in the armature
winding of a dynamo.

CHEMICAL EFFECT OF CURRENT

859

In a voltaic cell, the agency which gives rise to the e.m.f. is not so
easy to track down as in a dynamo; there has been much argument
about what is called the 'seat' of the e.m.f. We may start to seek
it by placing a penknife blade into a strong solution of copper sulphate
a pink film of metallic copper is deposited on the blade. It appears,
then, that copper ions have a tendency to go out of solution on to iron.
In the same way we can show that they tend to go out on to zinc.
Do metal ions ever tend to go the other way from solid metal into
solution? They certainly do if the solution is sulphuric acid and the
metal zinc or iron the metal enters the solution in the form of ions,
displaces the hydrogen ions, which are discharged and come off as gas,
and turns the solution into one of iron or zinc sulphate. But this
happens only if the zinc or iron is impure. Pure zinc in sulphuric acid

the solution becomes one of zinc sulphate which simply means that
it contains zinc ions in place of hydrogen ones. We can now form a
picture of what happens when a stick of pure zinc is put alone into
dilute sulphuric acid (Fig. 34.16). At first zinc ions leave the metal, and
go into the liquid. But they leave negative charges on the zinc rod,
which attract the zinc ions, and prevent any more from leaving.
Nothing further happens. But if we introduce a plate of copper, and
connect it to the zinc, electrons can flow from the zinc to the copper
(Fig. 34.15). At the copper they can neutralize the charges on hydrogen
ions, and to enable molecules to form and come off in bubbles. As the
electrons flow away from the zinc, more zinc ions can go into solution,

Polarization

The great disadvantage of the simple cell is that it does not give a
steady current; from the moment of making the circuit, the current
starts to fall, and after a minute or two it almost ceases to flow. The
current decays because a layer of hydrogen gas forms over the copper
plate; scraping the plate enables the current to start once more, but it
soon decays again. The hydrogen layer increases the internal resistance
of the cell, but we do not believe that this is the main reason for the
decay of the current If the copper plate is replaced by one
black (platinum with a finely grained surface), bubbles
very easily, and escape readily. The hydrogen layer may
more than one molecule thick; but the current decays as

hydrogen tends to go back into solution as positive hydrogen ions
(Fig. 34.18). In other words, it tends to behave in the same way as the
zinc rod, on the other side of the cell, which also goes into solution as
positive ions. Thus the hydrogen sets up an e.m.f. which opposes the

Water Voltameter

Polarization in

We

can find support for the idea of polarization in the behaviour of
the water voltameter (p. 856). When the potential difference across
the voltameter is less than 1-7 volts, the current through it falls to
zero in a minute or less. The voltameter itself can then deliver a current
for a short time. Its positive terminal, as a source, is that which was
its anode, and its negative terminal is that which was its cathode.
While current was being sent through the voltameter, the cathode
became covered with hydrogen, and the anode with oxygen. When the
voltameter acts as a source of current it has, in effect, electrodes of
oxygen and hydrogen and the current through the external circuit
flows from the oxygen plate to the hydrogen (Fig. 34.19). In the simple
cell, when it is polarized, there is no oxygen plate, but there is a hydrogen
one, and this lies over the copper plate. We may therefore suppose

Zinc in normal zinc sulphate solution becomes 1-03 volts negative. Now let us
imagine a Daniell cell in which zinc sulphate replaces the sulphuric acid, and both
solutions are normal. If we suppose that the solutions themselves set up no
appreciable potential difference at their interface, then we get a potential distribution like that shown in Fig. 33.20 (i). The difference in potential between the copper
and zinc is very nearly equal to the e.m.f. of a Daniell cell: 111 volts compared
with 1*08. We may attribute the difference to the fact that a Daniell cell in
practice has sulphuric acid, not zinc sulphate solution, in contact with the zinc;
also the solutions are not normal the acid is usually 1 to 4 of water, and the
copper sulphate is saturated.

A practically more useful cell is that devised by Leclanche. Its
negative electrode is a zinc rod in a strong solution of ammonium
chloride (Fig. 34.21). Its positive electrode is a carbon plate in a porous
pot packed with manganese dioxide, which acts as the depolarizer.

A standard cell without crystals of cadmium sulphate is called an
unsaturated cell; one with crystals is called a saturated cell, because
the crystals keep the solution saturated. Saturated cells give an
accurately reproducible e.m.f., because the concentration of the solution is sharply defined at any given temperature. Unsaturated cells
do not agree among one another so well, because the solution may vary
a little from one to the other. But the e.m.f. of a given unsaturated
cell varies less with temperature than that of a saturated cell, because
the concentration of the solution is constant.
The depolarizer of a standard cell is effective only for very small
currents, and the e.m.f. of the cell will change appreciably if more than
about 10 microamperes are drawn from it. A standard cell must not,
in any circumstances, be used as a source of current. In the early stages
of balancing a standard cell against a potentiometer wire, a protective

Properties and Care of the Lead Accumulator

The e.m.f. of a freshly charged lead accumulator is about 2-2 volts,
and the specific gravity of the acid about 1-25. When the cell is being
discharged its e.m.f. falls rapidly to about 2 volts, and then becomes
steady (Fig. 34.26); but towards the end of the discharge the e.m.f. begins
to fall again. When the terminal voltage load has dropped below about
1-9 volts, or the specific gravity of the acid below about 115, the cell
should be recharged. If the cell is discharged too far, or left in a discharged condition, hard lead sulphate forms on its plates, and it

accumulator may give, for example, 4 amperes for 20 hours before
needing a recharge. The capacity of this accumulator would be 80
ampere-hours. (One ampere-hour = 3600 coulombs.) If the accumulator were discharged faster at 8 amperes, say then it would
probably need recharging after rather less than 10 hours; and if it
were discharged more slowly say at 2 amperes it might hold out for
more than 40 hours. The capacity of an accumulator therefore depends

Magnetic

Field

and Force on Currents

Natural magnets were known some thousands of years ago, and in
the eleventh century a.d. the Chinese invented the magnetic compass.
This consisted of a magnet, floating on a buoyant support in a dish
of water. The respective ends of the magnet, where iron filings are
attracted most, are called the north and south poles.
In the thirteenth century the properties of magnets were studied by
Peter Peregrinus.

He showed

that

like poles repel

and

unlike poles attract

His work was forgotten, however, and his results were rediscovered in
the sixteenth century by Dr. Gilbert, who is famous for his researches
in

magnetism and

electrostatics.

Ferromagnetism

About 1823 Sturgeon placed an iron core into a coil carrying a
and found that the magnetic effect of the current was increased

current,

enormously. On switching off the current the iron lost nearly all its
magnetism. Iron, which can be magnetized strongly, is called a. ferromagnetic material. Steel, made by adding a small percentage of carbon
to iron, is also ferromagnetic. It retains its magnetism, however, after
removal from a current-carrying coil, and is more difficult to magnetize
than iron. Nickel and cobalt are the only other ferromagnetic elements
in addition to iron, and are widely used for modern magnetic apparatus.
A modern alloy for permanent magnets, called alnico, has the composition 54 per cent iron, 18 per cent nickel, 12 per cent cobalt, 6 per cent
copper, 10 per cent aluminium. It retains its magnetism extremely well,
and, by analogy with steel, is therefore said to be magnetically very
hard. Alloys which are very easily magnetized, but do not retain their
magnetism, are said to be magnetically soft. An example is mumetal,
which contains 76 per cent nickel, 17 per cent iron, 5 per cent copper,
2 per cent chromium.

Magnetic Fields

The region round a magnet, where a magnetic force is experienced,
a magnetic field. The appearance of a magnetic field is quickly
obtained by iron filings, and accurately plotted with a small compass,
as the reader knows. The direction of a magnetic field is taken as the
direction which a north pole would move if placed in the field.
Fig. 35.1 shows a few typical fields. The field round a bar-magnet is
'non-uniform', that is, its strength and direction vary from place to

Directions of Current and Field; Corkscrew Rule

The relationship between the direction of the lines of force and of the

driving a corkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of
rotation of the corkscrew is the direction of the lines of force. Fig. 35.4

Such a coil is called a solenoid; it has a field similar to that

by Ampere in 1820. As a result of them, he concluded that the force
on a conductor is always at right angles to the plane which contains both
the conductor and the direction of the field in which it is placed. He also
showed that, if the conductor makes an angle a with the field, the force
on it is proportional to sin a, so that the maximum force is exerted
when the conductor is perpendicular to the field.

An electron moving across a magnetic field experiences a force whether it is in

to the strength of the hair-springs, the geometry of the coil, and the
strength of the magnetic field The less sensitive models are more

because their pivots and springs are more robust, and
and hard use. Models
known as 'first grade' (FG) have an error not greater than 1 per cent
of full-scale deflection This error is constant over the scale, so that the
inaccuracy may be 10 per cent when the reading is one-tenth of full
scale. Readings less than about half full scale must therefore be avoided
in accurate work. The best moving-coil instruments have an error of
about 0-2 per cent of full-scale deflection.
When a galvanometer is of the suspended-coil type (Fig. 35.15 (i)), its
sensitivity is generally expressed in terms of the displacement of the
spot of light reflected from the mirror on to the scale. At a scale distance
of 1 metre a moderately sensitive instrument of this type will give a

The Wattmeter
The wattmeter is an instrument for measuring electrical power. In
construction and appearance it resembles a moving-coil voltmeter or
ammeter, but it has no permanent magnet Instead it has two fixed
coils, FF in Fig. 35.20; these set up the magnetic field in which the
suspended coil, M, moves. When the instrument is in use, the coils FF
are connected in series with the device X whose power consumption is

That is to say, the couple on the coil is proportional to the product of
the current through the device X, and the voltage across it. The couple
is therefore proportional to the power consumed by X, and the power
can be measured by the deflection of the coil.
The diagram shows that, because the volt-coil draws current, the
current through the fixed coils is a little greater than the current
through X. As a rule, the error arising from this is negligible; if not, it
can be allowed for as when a voltmeter and ammeter are used separately.

Hall Effect
In 1879, Hall found that an e.m.f. is set up transversely or across a
current-carrying conductor when a perpendicular magnetic field is
applied. This is called the
all effect.

This e.m.f. is very small and would be difficult to measure. The importance of
the Hall effect becomes apparent when semiconductors are used, as we now see.

Hall Effect in Semiconductors
In semiconductors, the charge carriers which produce a current

when they move may be positively or negatively charged (see p. 1024).
The Hall effect helps us to find the sign of the charge carried. In Fig.
suppose that electrons were not responsible for carrying
and that the current was due to the movement of positive
charges in the same direction as the conventional current. The magnetic
force on these charges would also be downwards, in the same direction
as if the current were carried by electrons. This is because the sign and
35.21, p. 890,

the current,

the direction of movement of the charge carriers have both been reversed.
Thus AB would now become positively charged, and the polarity of the
Hall voltage would be reversed. Experimental investigation of the
polarity of the Hall voltage hence tells us whether the current is predominantly due to the drift of positive charges or to the drift of negative

current flowed through the galvanometer, as in all Faraday's

happened to notice that the galvanometer needle gave a kick. And when
he connected the battery back again, he noticed a kick in the opposite
direction. However often he disconnected and reconnected the battery,
he got the same results. The 'kicks' could hardly be all accidental—

changing the field building up as the current in A was switched on,
decaying as the current in A was switched off. And the current which
flowed in B while the field was decaying was in the opposite direction
to the current which flowed while the field was building up. Faraday
called the current in B an induced current. He found that it could be
made much greater by winding the two coils on an iron core, instead
of a wooden one.
895

896

Once he had realized that an induced current was produced only by
a change in the magnetic field inducing it, Faraday was able to find
induced currents wherever he had previously sought them. In place of
the coil A he used a magnet, and showed that as long as the coil and
the magnet were at rest, there was no induced current (Fig. 36.2 (i)).
But when he moved either the coil or the magnet an induced current
flowed as long as the motion continued (Fig. 36.2 (ii)). If the current
flowed one way when the north pole of the magnet was approaching

Since a flow of current implies the presence of an e.m.f., Faraday's
experiments showed that an e.m.f. could be induced in a coil by moving
it relatively to a magnetic field. In discussing induction it is more
fundamental to deal with the e.m.f. than the current, because the
current depends on both the e.m.f. and the resistance.

we can find this out with a battery and a megohm resistor (Fig. 36.3 (i)).
We then take a coil whose direction of winding we know, and connect
this to the galvanometer. In turn we plunge each pole of a magnet into
and out of the coil and we get the results shown in Fig. 36.3 (ii), (iii), (iv).
These results were generalized most elegantly into a rule by Lenz in
1835. He said that the induced current flows always in such a direction as
to oppose the change which is giving rise to it. If the reader will sketch
with a pencil on Fig. 36.3 the magnetic fields of the induced currents,
then he will see what Lenz meant when the magnet is approaching the

Magnitude of E.M.F.
Accurate experiments on induction are difficult to contrive with
simple apparatus; but rough-and-ready experiments will show on what
factors the magnitude depends. We require coils of the same diameter
but different numbers of turns, coils of the same number of turns but
different diameters, and two similar magnets, which we can use singly
or together. If we use a high-resistance galvanometer, the current will
not vary much with the resistance of the coil in which the e.m.f. is
induced, and we can take the deflection as a measure of the e.m.f.
There is no need to plunge the magnet into and out of the coil we can

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

by simply
turning the coil through a right angle,
so that its plane changes from parallel
to perpendicular to the magnet, or vice
versa (Fig. 36.5). We find that the induced e.m.f. increases with:

To generalize these results and to build up useful formulae, we use
the idea of magnetic flux, or field lines passing through a coil. Fig.
36.6 shows a coil, of area A, whose normal makes an angle 9 with
a uniform magnetic field of induction B. The component of the field at
right angles to the plane of the coil is B cos 9, and we say that the
magnetic flux

<I>

through the

coil is

<S>

= AB cos 9

(1)

(We get the same result if we multiply the field-strength B by the
area projected at right angles to the field, A cos 9) If either the strength
of the field is changed, or the coil is turned so as to change the angle 9,
then the flux through the coil changes.
Results (i) to (iii) above, therefore, show that
the e.m.f. induced in a coil increases with the
rate of change of the magnetic flux through it.
More accurate experiments show that the induced
e.m.f. is actually proportional to the rate of
change of flux through the coil; this result is

rate of change of the magnetic flux through the iron core.
Because of the great number of secondary turns, the secondary e.m.f.s
may be high and of the order of thousands of volts (Fig. 36.13 (ii)).
In practice, an induction coil such as we have described consisting
simply of primary, secondary, and contact-breaker would not give
high secondary e.m.f.s. For, at the make of the primary current, the
current would rise slowly, because of the self-inductance (see p. 924) of
the primary winding. The rate of change of flux linked with the secondary would therefore be small, and the secondary e.m.f. low. And at the
break of the primary current a spark would pass between the contacts of
the make-and-break. The spark would allow primary current to continue to flow, and the primary current would fall slowly. At the instant of
break, before the spark began, the primary current would be falling
rapidly and the secondary e.m.f. would be high; but the e.m.f. would
remain high for only a very short time: as soon as the spark passed the
secondary e.m.f. would fall to a value about as low as at make.
Nothing can be done about the low secondary e.m.f. at make. But
the secondary e.m.f at break can be made high, by preventing sparking
at the contact-breaker. To prevent sparking, a capacitor, C in Fig. 36.13,

primary current at the instant of break but in doing so it prevents the induced
e.m.f. in the primary from rising high enough to start a spark. And the rate at
which the primary current falls, in charging the capacitor, is greater than the
rate at which it would fall if a. spark were passing. Thus, with a capacitor, the
secondary e.m.f. is less at the instant of break than without one, but it is greater
throughout the rest of the fall of the primary current. Consequently the average
secondary voltage at break is higher with a capacitor than without in practice
it is much higher. To get the greatest possible secondary voltage, the capacitance
of the capacitor is chosen so that it just suppresses sparking at the contacts. The
secondary voltage is then a series of almost unidirectional pulses, as shown in

The ends of the coil are connected to

insulating material, also not shown.
Contact with the rings is made by

a lamp L. As the coil rotates, the

is induced in it which flows, via the
carbon blocks, through the lamp.

proportionately greater. In the small alternators used for bicycle lighting the armature is stationary, and the field is provided by permanent
magnets, which rotate around it. In this way rubbing contacts, for
leading the current into and out of the armature, are avoided.
When no current is being drawn from a generator, the horse-power
required to turn its armature is merely that needed to overcome

drawn, the horse-power required increases, to provide the electrical
power. The current, flowing through the armature winding, causes the
magnetic field to set up a couple which opposes the rotation of the
armature, and so demands the extra horse-power. The reader should

When a

This current flows in such a direction as to reduce the flux in the
core. At the instant that the load is connected, therefore, the backe.m.f. in the primary falls. The primary current then increases. The
increase in primary current increases the flux through the core, and
continues until the flux is restored to its original value. The back-e.m.f.
in the primary is then again equal to the applied voltage, and equilibrium is restored. But now a greater primary current is flowing than
before the secondary was loaded. Thus the power drawn from the
secondary is drawn, in turn, from the supply to which the primary is
connected.
Transformers are used to step up the voltage generated at a power
station, from 11000 to 132000 volts for high-tension transmission
(p. 793). After transmission they are used to step it down again to a
value safer for distribution (240 volts in houses). Inside a house a transformer may be used to step the voltage down from 240 to 4, for ringing
bells. Transformers with several secondaries are used in, for example,

In practice, as in an alternator, the armature coil is wound with
insulated wire on a soft iron core, and the field-magnet is energized by
a current (Fig. 36.20). This current is provided by the dynamo itself.
The steel of the field-magnet has always a small residual magnetism,
so that as soon as the armature is turned an e.m.f. is induced in it. This
then sends a current through the field winding, which increases the
field and the e.m.f.; the e.mi. rapidly builds up to its working value.

Generators of this kind are called homopolar because the e.m.f.
induced in the moving conductor is always in the same sense. They
are sometimes used for electroplating, where only a small voltage is
required, but they are not useful for most purposes, because they give
too small an e.m.f. The e.m.f. of a commutator dynamo can be made
large by having many turns in the coil but the e.m.f. of a homopolar
dynamo is limited to that induced in one radius of the disc.
;

Applications of Alternating and Direct Currents

Direct currents are less easy to generate than alternating currents,

and alternating e.m.f.s are more convenient to step up and to step
down, and to distribute over a wide area. The national grid system,
which supplies electricity to the whole country, is therefore fed with
alternating current. Alternating current

just as suitable for heating

also equally suitable for lighting, because

filament lamps depend on the heating effect, and gas-discharge lamps

direct. Small motors, of the size used in vacuum-cleaners and common
machine-tools, run satisfactorily on alternating current, but large ones,
as a general rule, do not. Direct current is therefore used on most
electric railway and tramway systems. These systems either have their
own generating stations, or convert alternating current from the grid
into direct current. One way of conveying alternating current into
direct is to use a valve rectifier, whose principle we shall describe later.
For electro-chemical processes alternating current is useless. The
chemical effect of a current reverses with its direction, and if, therefore,
we tried to deposit a metal by alternating current, we would merely
cause a small amount of the metal to be alternately deposited and

current must be rectified.

Eddy-currents

dynamo is built up from thin sheets of
from one another by an even thinner film of oxide,
as shown in Fig. 36.23 (i). These are called laminations, and the armature
is said to be laminated. If the armature were solid, then, since iron is a
conductor, currents would be induced in it by its motion across the
magnetic field (Fig. 36.23 (ii)). These currents would absorb power by
opposing the rotation of the armature, and they would dissipate that
power as heat, which would damage the insulation of the winding; but

the armature is laminated, these currents cannot flow, because
the induced e.m.f. acts at right angles to the laminations, and therefore
to the insulation between them. The magnetization of the core, however, is not affected, because it acts along the laminations. Thus the

Eddy-currents, by Lenz's law, always tend to oppose the motion of
a solid conductor in a magnetic field. The opposition can be shown in
many ways. One of the most impressive is to make a chopper with a
thick copper blade, and to try to slash it between the poles of a strong
electromagnet; then to hold it delicately and allow it to drop between
them The resistance to the motion in the former case can be felt.
Sometimes eddy-currents can be made use of—for example, in
damping a galvanometer. When a current is passed through the coil
of a galvanometer, it applies a couple to the coil which sets it swinging.
If the swings are opposed only by the viscosity of the air, they decay
very slowly and are said to be naturally damped (Fig. 36.24). The
pointer or light-spot takes a long time to come to its final steady
deflection 0. To bring the spot or pointer more rapidly to rest, the
damping must be increased. One way of increasing the damping is to
wind the coil on a metal former. Then, as the coil swings, the field of

were not damped. Galvanometer coils which are wound on insulating
formers can be damped by short-circuiting a few of their turns, or by
connecting an external shunt across the whole coil. With a shunt the
eddy-currents circulate round the coil and shunt, independently of the
current to be measured. The smaller the shunt, the greater the eddycurrents and the damping; if the coil is overdamped, as shown in
Fig. 36.24, it may take almost as long to come to rest as when it is
undamped The damping which is just sufficient to prevent overshoot
is called 'critical' damping.

The power dissipated as heat in the armature is I 2 R a — 100 x 1 = 100 watts.
The power supplied to the armature is I V = 10 x 230 = 2300 watts, and the
mechanical power is IaE = 10 x 220 = 2200 watts. Of the power supplied to
the armature, the fraction which appears as mechanical power is 2200/2300 = 96

The working efficiency of the motor will be a little less than this, because
some of the mechanical power will be used in overcoming friction in

Shunt Field

Shunt-wound motors are used for driving machine-tools, and in other
jobs where a steady speed is required. A shunt motor keeps a nearly
steady speed for the following reason. If the load is increased, the
speed falls a little; the back-e.m.f. then falls in proportion to the speed,
and the current rises, enabling the motor to develop more power
to overcome the increased load. In the example, p. 916, if the speed
falls by 1 part in 220, the back-e.m.f. falls from 220 to 219 V. The
current then rises from

They develop a great starting torque because the armature current flows

very great.

A series motor does not keep such a steady speed as a shunt motor. Just as in
a shunt motor, when the load increases the speed falls; and the fall in speed
decreases the back-e.m.f., and allows more current to flow. But, as we will see in
a moment, the back-e.m.f., in a series motor, does not fall with the speed as
sharply as it does in a shunt motor. To meet a given increase in load, the armature
current must increase by a definite amount. And therefore the back-e.m.f. must
fall by a definite amount. But it falls less with the speed than it does in a shunt
motor. Consequently, to meet a given increase in load, the speed of a series motor
must fall more than that of a shunt motor.

CHARGE AND FLUX LINKAGE
Flux and Charge relation

We have already seen that an electromotive force is induced in
a circuit when the magnetic flux linked with it changes. If the circuit
is closed, a current flows, and electric charge is carried round the circuit.
As we shall now show, there is a simple relationship between the charge
and the change of flux.

can be seen from the last section that the charge which flows
round a given circuit is directly proportional to the change of flux
linkage. If the charge flowing is measured by a ballistic galvanometer G,
as shown in Fig. 36.29, then we have a measure of the change in flux
linkage, O.
Ballistics is the study of the motion of a body, such as a projectile,
which is set off by a blow, and then allowed to move freely. By freely,
we mean without friction. A ballistic galvanometer is one used to
measure an electrical blow, or impulse for example, the charge Q which
circulates when a capacitor is discharged through it. A galvanometer
which is intended to be used ballistically has a heavier coil than one
which is not; and it has as little damping as possible an insulating

The Earth Inductor
As another example of the use of a search coil and ballistic galvanometer, we describe a method that has been used for measuring the
angle of dip of the earth's magnetic field (p. 944). The earth's field is so
nearly uniform that the search coil may be large, usually about 30 cm
square; but the field is also so weak that even a large coil must have
many turns of the order of 100. The coil, which is called an earth
inductor, is pivoted in a wooden frame, and this is fitted with stops so
that the coil can be turned rapidly through 180° (Fig. 36.31). To find

Self-induction

The phenomenon which we call self-induction was discovered by the
American, Joseph Henry, in 1832. He was led to it by a theoretical
argument, starting from the phenomena of induced e.m.f., which he
had discovered at about the same time as Faraday.
When a current flows through a coil, it sets up a magnetic field. And
that field threads the coil which produces it. Fig. 36.33 (i). If the current
through the coil is changed by means of a variable resistance, for
example the flux linked with the turn of the coil changes. An e.m.f. is
therefore induced in the coil. By Lenz's law the direction of the induced
e.m.f. will be such as to oppose the change of curent the e.m.f. will be

Back-E.M.F.

When an e.m.f. is induced in a circuit by a change in the current
through that circuit, the process of induction is called self-induction.
The e.m.f. induced is called a back-e.m.f. Self-induction opposes the
growth of current in a coil, and so makes it gradual. This effect can be
demonstrated by connecting an iron-cored coil of many turns in series
with an ammeter and a few accumulators (Fig. 36.34 (i)). (The ammeter

Non-inductive Coils

In bridge circuits, such as are used for resistance measurements, selfinduction is a nuisance. When the galvanometer key of a bridge is
closed, the currents in the arms of the bridge are redistributed, unless
the bridge happens to be balanced. While the currents are being
redistributed they are changing, and self-induction delays the reaching

new equilibrium. Thus the galvanometer deflection at the instant
of closing the key, does not correspond to the steady state which the
bridge will eventually reach. It may therefore be misleading. To

Energy Stored; E.M.F. at Break
The spark which passes when the. current in a coil is interrupted liberates
energy in the form of heat and light. This energy has been stored in the magnetic
field of the coil, just as the energy of a charged capacitor is stored in the electrostatic field between its plates (p. 779). When the current in the coil is first switched
on, the back-e.m.f. opposes the rise of current; the current flows against the
back-e.m.f. and therefore does work against it (p. 795): When the current becomes

through the coil tends to maintain the current but now the current can continue to
flow for a brief time ; it can flow by charging the capacitor (Fig. 36.36 (ii)). Consequently the current does not decay as rapidly as it would without the capacitor,
and the back-e.m.f. never rises as high. If the capacitance of the capacitor is great
enough, the potential difference across it (and therefore across the switch) never
rises high enough to cause a spark.

Mutual Induction

We have already seen than an e.m.f. may be induced in one circuit by a changing
current in another (Fig. 36.1, p. 895). The phenomenon is often called mutual
induction, and the pair of circuits which show it are said to have mutual inductance. The mutual inductance,

Magnetic Fields of Current-Carrying
Conductors

In the previous chapters, the induction or flux density B in a magnetic
field was used to find the force on conductors and the e.m.f. induced in
conductors. In this chapter we shall see how the magnitude of B is
calculated. This depends on the geometry of the conductor, that is,
whether it is a straight wire, or a coil, or a solenoid. The geometry also
determines the pattern of the lines of force in the field.

Law of Biot and Savart
To calculate B for any shape of conductor, Biot and Savart gave a
law which can now be stated as follows The induction or flux density

The formula in (1) cannot be proved directly, as we cannot experiment
with an infinitesimally small conductor. We believe in its truth because
the deductions for large practical conductors turn out to be true.
The constant of proportionality in equation (1) depends on the
medium in which the conductor is situated. In air (or, more exactly, in

When the a.c. supply is switched on, the varying flux through S
produces an induced alternating e.mi. E. The peak value of E can be
determined by switching off the time-base and measuring the length
of the line trace, Fig. 37.3 (ii). See p. 1014. Now the peak value of B, the
magnetic induction, is proportional to the peak value of E, as shown
in the case of the simple dynamo on p. 907. Thus the length of the trace
gives a measure of the peak value of B.
The distance r of the coil from
is then increased and the corresponding length of the trace is measured. The length of the trace plotted
against 1/r gives a straight line graph passing through the origin.
Hence B oc 1/r. A similar method can be used for investigating the

Helmholtz Coils
The field along the

axis of a single coil varies with the distance x from the coil.
In order to obtain a uniform field, Helmholtz used two coaxial parallel coils of
equal radius R, separated by a distance R. In this case, when the same current

flows round each coil in the same direction, the resultant field B is uniform for
some distance on either side of the point on their axis midway between the
coils. This may be seen roughly by adding the fields due to each coil alone.

Very Long Solenoid or Toroid
Equation (1) shows that the field along the axis of an infinite
solenoid is constant: it depends only on the number of turns per

book, it can also be shown that the field is the same at points not on

A 'Slinky' is a coil which can be stretched to provide simply a solenoid
with a varying number of turns per metre, n. A small search coil with
many thousands of turns, placed coaxially inside the solenoid, can be
connected to an oscilloscope to provide a measure of B when alternating
current is passed into the solenoid. See p. 934. Since n oc 1/L, where L
is the length of the coil, a graph of B against 1/L can be plotted for
various values of L, the current being the same each time. A straight
line through the origin is obtained, showing that B oc n. A search
coil connected to a ballistic galvanometer, and a direct current which
is reversed in the coil, may also be used to provide a measure of B
(p. 919).

Forces between Currents

Ampere carried out many experiments on the forces of attraction
and repulsion between two current-carrying conductors. Each was
acted on by the field of the other, as shown in Fig. 37.8. Currents
flowing in the same direction ('like' currents) attracted each other,

Earth's Magnetism

was Dr. Gilbert who

first showed that a magnetized needle, when
suspended about its centre of gravity, dipped downwards towards
the north at about 70° to the horizontal in England. He also found that

It

this angle of dip increased with latitude, as shown in Fig. 37.13, and
concluded that the earth itself was, or contained, a magnet. The points
where the angle of dip is 90° are called the earth's magnetic poles they

are fairly near to the geographic poles, but their positions are continuously, though slowly, changing. Gilbert's simple idea of the earth as a

magnet has had to be rejected. The earth's crust does not contain
enough magnetic material to make a magnet of the required strength
the earth's core is, we believe, molten
and molten iron is non-magnetic.
The origin of the earth's magnetism is, in fact, one of the great theoretical
problems of the present day.

—

Horizontal and Vertical Components. Variation and Dip
Since a freely suspended magnetic needle dips downward at some
angle S to the horizontal, the earth's resultant magnetic field, B R acts at
an angle S to the horizontal. The 'angle of dip', or inclination, can

horizontal. The earth's field has a vertical component, B

materials are capable of retaining their magnetization and forming
strong permanent magnets. Others form temporary magnets (p. 954).
The relationship between B, the flux density in a material, and the
applied magnetizing field or force
is best investigated experimentally
by using a toroid shaped specimen. This eliminates the reduction in
the field due to the effect of poles at the ends of a cylindrical rod.
However, in the experiment described shortly, a specimen is placed
inside a long current-carrying solenoid. This does not produce as large
a value B as that obtained with a toroid, but the essential features of

coil is sharply removed from the vicinity of the specimen the throw
on the galvanometer gives a measure of the flux change (see p. 920).
Since the number of turns and area of the coil is constant, this throw
will be proportional to the flux density B.
Ths specimen is first demagnetized (see p. 958) and placed in the
solenoid. The current I is now increased in steps from zero, and the
corresponding deflections on the ballistic galvanometer are observed.
The specimen is taken through a magnetic cycle of magnetization.
This is done by increasing I until is nearly constant, when the specimen
has become saturated, then reducing I to zero and reversing it until
saturation is reached in the opposite direction, and finally reducing J

We now see that, when once the iron has been magnetized, its
magnetization curve never passes through the origin again. Instead,
it forms the closed loop PQRS, which is called a hysteresis loop.
Hysteresis, which comes from a Greek work meaning 'delayed', can
be defined as the lagging of the magnetic induction, B, behind the magnetizing field, H, when the specimen is taken through a magnetic cycle.
Properties of Magnetic Materials

Fig 38.7 shows the hysteresis loops of iron and steel. Steel is more
permanent magnets, because its high coercivity means that
it is not easily demagnetized by shaking. The fact that the remanence
of iron is a little greater than that of steel is completely outweighed by
its much smaller coercivity, which makes it very easy to demagnetize.
On the other hand, iron is much more suitable for electromagnets,
which have to be switched on and off, as in relays. Iron is also more
suitable for the cores of transformers and the armatures of machines.
Both of these go through complete magnetizing cycles continuously:
transformer cores because they are magnetized by alternating current,
armatures because they are turning round and round in a constant field.
In each cycle the iron passes through two parts of its hysteresis loop
(near
and S in Fig. 38.6), where the magnetizing field is having to
demagnetize the iron. There the field is doing work against the internal

In a large transformer the hysteresis loss, together with the heat
developed by the current in the resistance of the windings, liberates so
much heat that the transformer must be artificially cooled. The cooling
is done by circulating oil, which itself is cooled by the atmosphere it
passes through pipes which can be seen outside the transformer, running

core is designed so that it is never saturated under working conditions.
For, if it were saturated, the flux through it would not follow the

Diamagnetism, Paramagnetism, Ferromagnetism

We have already mentioned that the magnetic properties of materials
are due to circulating

and spinning electrons within the atoms.

Diamagnetism
If a magnetic field is produced in the neighbourhood of a magnetic material,
a changing flux occurs in the current loops within the atoms. An e.m.f. or electric
field will then be set up which causes the electrons to alter their motions, so that
an extra or induced current is produced. By Lenz's law, this current gives rise to a
magnetic field which opposes the applied magnetic field H. Thus the induced
magnetization will be in the opposite direction to H, that is, M/H is negative.
Hence the susceptibility % is negative. This phenomenon is called diamagnetism.
For a diamagnetic material, x is generally very small, about —0000015 for
bismuth, for example. The relative permeability, n, which is given by n t = 1+%,
is thus generally slightly less than 1. All substances have a diamagnetic contribution to their susceptibility, since the induced currents always oppose the
applied field. In many substances, the diamagnetism is completely masked by
another magnetic phenomenon (p. 953).

a resultant magnetic moment. Generally, the thermal motions of the
atoms will cause these magnetic moments to be oriented purely at random
and there will be no resultant magnetization. If, however, a field is applied,
each atomic moment will try to set in the direction of the field but the thermal
motions will prevent complete alignment. In this case there will be overall weak
magnetization in the direction of the applied field. This accounts for the phenomenon of paramagnetization.
It is clear that paramagnetism is temperature dependent. At low temperatures,
the thermal motions will be less successful at preventing the alignment of the
atomic moments and so the susceptibility will be larger. At higher temperatures
thermal motion will make alignment difficult. At very high temperatures, the
material may become diamagnetic, for the diamagnetic contribution to # is not

Ferromagnetism. Magnetic Domain Theory

A

ferromagnetic material has a very high value of susceptibility, x, and hence
of relative permeability, (x r The value of ^r can be several thousands. Like a
paramagnetic material, the magnetization is in the direction of the applied field
and a rod of a ferromagnetic material will align itself along the field.
In a paramagnetic substance which is not subjected to a magnetic field, the
magnetic moments are oriented purely at random due to the thermal vibrations.
In a ferromagnetic material, however, strong 'interactions' are present between
the moments, the nature of which requires quantum theory to understand it
and is outside the scope of this work. These cause neighbouring moments to
align, even in the absence of an applied field, with the result that tiny regions of
very strong magnetism are obtained inside the unmagnetized material called

magnetic domains. Above a critical temperature called the Curie point, ferromagnetics become paramagnetics (see Table, p. 956).

Domains and Magnetization
Some of the phenomena in magnetization

of ferromagnetic material can now
be explained In an unmagnetized specimen, the domains are oriented in different
directions. The net magnetization is then zero. If a small magnetic field
is
applied, there is some small rotation of the magnetization within the domains,
which produces an overall component of magnetization in the direction of H.
This occurs in the region AB of the magnetization-field (M-H) curve shown in

The polarity of each pair of ends reverses with the current, but whichever direction the current has, the iron rods repel each other. The force
on the pivoted rod is therefore always in the same direction, and the
pointer is deflected through an angle which is proportional to the
average force. To a fair approximation, the magnetization of the rods

Another type of 'square law' instrument is the hot-wire ammeter

heat mainly by convection at a rate equal to the average rate at
which heat is developed in the wire. The rise in temperature of the wire

which is held taut by a spring. The

Root-mean-square value of A.C.

On

907 we saw that an alternating current / varied sinusoidally
could be represented by the equation I = Im sin cot, where Im
was the peak (maximum) value of the current. In commercial practice,
alternating currents are always measured and expressed in terms of
their root-mean-square (r.m.s.) value, which we shall now consider.
Consider two resistors of equal resistance R, one carrying an alternating current and the other a direct current. Suppose both are

the root-mean-square value of an alternating current is defined as that

A.C. through a Capacitor

many

In

radio circuits, resistors, capacitors, and coils are present.

An alternating current can flow through a resistor, but it is not obvious
at first that it can flow through a capacitor. This can be demonstrated,
however, by wiring a capacitor, of capacitance one or more microfarads, in series with a neon lamp, and connecting them to the a.c.
mains via a plug. In place of the neon lamp we could use a mains
filament lamp of low rating, such as 25 watts. The lamp lights up,
showing that a current is flowing through it.

The current flows because the capacitor plates are being continually
charged, discharged, and charged the other way round by the alternating voltage of the mains (Fig. 39.4). The current thus flows round
the circuit, and can be measured by an a.c. milliammeter inserted in
any of the connecting wires.
To find the amplitude of the current, let us denote the amplitude of
the voltage by Vm , and its frequency by/ Then, as in equation (3),

(1)

Equation (1) shows that the amplitude of the current is 2nfCVm
proportional to the frequency, the capacitance, and the voltage amplitude. These results are easy to explain. The greater the voltage, or the
capacitance, the greater the charge on the plates, and therefore the
greater the current required to charge or discharge the capacitor. And
the higher the frequency, the more rapidly is the capacitor charged
and discharged, and therefore again the greater the current.
A more puzzling feature of equation (1) is the factor giving the time
variation of the current, cos 2nft. It shows that the current varies a
quarter-cycle out of step with the voltage
or, as is more often said,
n/2 out of phase. Fig. 39.4 shows this variation, and also helps to
explain it. When the voltage is a maximum, so is the charge on the
capacitor. It is therefore not charging and the current is zero. When
the voltage starts to fall, the capacitor starts to discharge; the rate of
discharging, or current, reaches its maximum when the capacitor is
completely discharged and the voltage across it is zero.

A.C. through an Inductor
Since a coil is made from conducting wire, we have no difficulty in
seeing that an alternating current can flow through it. However, if the

has appreciable self-induatance, the current is less than would flow
through a non-inductive coil wthe same resistance. We have already
seen how self-inductance opposes changes of current it must therefore
oppose an alternating current, which is continuously changing.
Let us suppose that the resistance of the coil is negligible, a condition
which can easily be satisfied in practice. We can simplify the theory
by considering first the current, and working back to find the potential
difference across the coil. Let us therefore denote the current by
coil

(2)

Equation (2) shows that the amplitude of the voltage across a pure
inductance (without resistance) is
proportional to the frequency, the

magnitude of the self-inductance,
and the amplitude of the current.

The reader is left to work out the
physical explanation of these three
facts for himself.

The voltage across a pure inductance is a quarter-cycle, or n/2

explained by considering the relationship between the back-e.m.f., and the changing current, which the

reader should do for himself.
The phase relationship between current and voltage for a pure
inductance is, however, different from that for a capacitor. For, as
Fig. 39.5 shows, the current through an inductance lags n/2 behind the
voltage; that is to say, it passes its maxima a quarter-cycle later than
the voltage. On the other hand, in a capacitor the current passes its
maxima a quarter-cycle ahead of the voltage (Fig. 39.4) we say that it
leads the voltage by n/2.
:

Reactance

The term reactance is used to denote the opposition which an
inductance or capacitor offers to the passage of an alternating current.
We do not use the term resistance for this, because we have already
denned resistance as the property of a circuit which enables it to
dissipate electrical power as heat and we have just seen that a capacitor
or a pure inductance dissipates no electrical power at all.
We define the reactance of an inductor L, or capacitor C, by the

which varies sinusoidally with time may be represented as the projection of a rotating vector (p. 44). Alternating currents and voltages
may therefore be represented in this way. Fig. 39.6 shows, on the

the voltage can be resolved into a component Fcos 6 in phase with
the current, and a voltage VsinB perpendicular to the current (Fig.
39.14). The former component, Kcos 0, represents that part of the

Production of Magnetic Field from Moving Electric Field
It has already been shown that moving charges in a wire produce a

way. We can say that each charge produces an electric field moving
with the charge, and that this moving electric field sets up a magnetic

This is just the speed of light and radio waves, as determined by experiment. It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that waves such as light
and radio waves which move with this speed are electromagnetic in
nature.

Demonstration of Electromagnetic Waves. Transmission Line
Electromagnetic waves of high frequency, such as radio waves, can
be radiated into space by aerials. The electrical circuit producing the
waves is called an oscillator (p. 1019) and it is connected to the aerial
by wires called a transmission line.
The effect of electromagnetic waves travelling in a transmission line
can be demonstrated with the aid of a very high frequency (v.h.f.)
oscillator producing electrical oscillations of about 150 MHz frequency. The output from this oscillator is fed to two parallel transmission lines a few centimetres apart. Fig. 39.19. The line is terminated
by a short circuit (that is, a piece of wire clipped to the two lines),

whose position along the

line may be varied. As a neon bulb is moved
variations in intensity are produced; the peaks of
intensity are separated by a distance of about 100 cm. The greatest
variations are obtained by adjusting the position of the short circuit.
At the points marked by

At these points on the wire, therefore, there are voltage antinodes.
Thus a voltage standing wave is produced on the line. Since nodes are

If the neon bulb is replaced by a small filament lamp (which, unlike
the neon, has a very low resistance) it is found that the lamp glows

brightest, not at the voltage antinodes, but at the voltage nodes. This

because the low resistance lamp is sensitive to current in the line and
not to voltage. Thus there are current antinodes at voltage nodes, and

This situation is very like the standing waves set up in a resonating
pipe open at both ends (p. 648). In this electrical case, resonance is
obtained by adjusting the short circuit. In a pipe, resonance may be
obtained by adjusting the length of the tube. As illustrated in Fig. 39.31,

The plane containing the magnetic field B is at right angles to the plane

mutually perpendicular (compare Fig. 39.15 and 39.17).

The phenomenon of polarization of light is explained in an exactly

plane and its magnetic field in a perpendicular plane. Unpolarized light
has electric and magnetic vibrations in all planes perpendicular to the
direction of propagation.

Wave Properties of Electromagnetic Waves

We have already seen how standing (stationary) waves on transmission lines (guided waves), and the polarization of electromagnetic
waves, can be demonstrated. It can also be shown that electromagnetic
waves, like all waves, can undergo reflection, refraction, interference and
diffraction. The apparatus described on p. 987 has a frequency of
150
and hence the wavelength X = c/f= 3 x 10 8 /(150x 10 6 )
metres = 2 metres = 200 cm. This is rather long for demonstration
experiments in a teaching laboratory. Microwaves of about 3 cm
wavelength are therefore used. These are radiated from a horn waveguide T and are received by a similar waveguide R or smaller probe.
The detected wave then produces a deflection in a connected meter.
Some experiments which can be performed in a school laboratory are

with which we assume the reader is familiar. One example is the
irregular motion of smoke particles in air, which can be observed
by means of a microscope. This is due to continuous bombardment of
a tiny smoke particle by numerous air molecules all round it. The air
molecules move with different velocities in different directions. The
resultant force on the smoke particle is therefore unbalanced, and
irregular in magnitude and direction. Larger particles do not show

Brownian motion when struck on

all sides by air molecules. The

More evidence of the existence of molecules is supplied by the
successful predictions made by the kinetic theory of gases. This theory
assumes that a gas consists of millions of separate particles or molecules
moving about in all directions. X-ray diffraction patterns of crystals
also provides evidence for the particle nature of matter. The symmetrical patterns of spots obtained are those which one would expect
from a three-dimensional grating or lattice formed from particles. A

Particle Nature of Electricity

In electrolysis, we assume that the carriers of current through an
acid or salt solution are ions, which may be positively and negatively

charged (p. 846). From Faraday's laws of electrolysis, the charge
carried by each ion is proportional to its valency (p. 845), We can find
the charge on a monovalent ion using the following argument.
Avogadro's constant, about 602 x 10 23 is the number of molecules
in one mole. In electrolysis, 96500 coulombs (one faraday) is the
quantity of electricity required to deposit one mole of a monovalent
element (see p. 845). When the element is monatomic, the number of
ions of one kind which carry this charge is equal to the number of
molecules. Thus the charge on each ion is given by 96500/602 x 10 23
_19
19
or l-6xlO
C. If l-6xlO" C is denoted by the symbol e, the
charge on any ion is then e, 2e, or 3e, etc., depending on its valency.
Thus e is a basic unit of charge.
All charges, whether produced in electrostatics, current electricity
or any other method, are multiples of the basic unit e. Evidence that this
is the case was obtained by Millikan, who, in 1909, designed an experi,

ment

to

measure the unit

e.

Theory of Millikan's experiment
Millikan first measured the terminal velocity of an oil-drop falling
through air. He then charged the oil-drop and applied an electric field
to oppose gravity. The drop now moved with a different terminal
velocity, which was again measured.
Suppose the radius of the oil-drop is a, the densities of oil and air are
and
a respectively, and the viscosity of air is r\. When the drop, withp

of the upper plate (Fig. 40.1). He used a fine spray to 'atomize' the
oil and create tiny drops above H, and occasionally one would find
its way through H, and would be observed in a low-power microscope

drop was seen as a pin-point of light, and its downward velocity
was measured by timing its fall through a known distance by means of
a scale in the eyepiece. The field was applied by connecting a battery
of several thousand volts across the plates A, B, and its intensity E
was known, since E = V/d, where V is the p.d. between the plates and
d is their distance apart. Millikan found that the friction between the
drops when they were formed by the spray created electric charge, but
to give a drop an increased charge an X-ray tube was operated near
the

chamber

to ionize the air.

From

equation (hi), it follows that when v lt v 2 , E, p, a and r\ are all
known, the charge e' on the drop can be calculated. Millikan found,
working with hundreds of drops, that the charge e' was always a simple
multiple of a basic unit, 1-6 x 10~ 19 coulomb. He thus concluded that

the charge e was numerically 1-6 x 10 19 coulomb.

CATHODE RAYS (ELECTRONS) AND
PROPERTIES
Atomic physics can be said to have begun with the study of the
conduction of electricity through gases. The passage of electricity
through a gas, called a 'discharge', was familiar to Faraday, but the
steady conduction as distinct from sparks takes place when the
pressure of the gas is less than about 50
Hg; in a neon lamp it is
about 10
Hg.

walls of the tube fluoresce, in the way we have already described. The
electrons flying across the space are called cathode rays. Where they
strike the anode they produce X-rays (p. 1067).

The Mechanism of Conduction

How are the ions and electrons in a gaseous discharge produced? A
luminous discharge requires a voltage, V, of at least a hundred volts
across the gas at pressures of about 1
Hg. At much higher or
lower pressures, it may require thousands of volts. But with a voltage
of about ten, although there is no glow, a very weak current, J, can be
detected—of the order of 10" 15 amp (Fig. 40.4 (i)). This we attribute

1076) ; a trace of ultra-violet light in the laboratory would account
for the emission. When the voltage is increased the electrons are
accelerated by the electric field to a higher speed, and strike the gas
atoms more violently on their way to the anode. When the voltage is
high enough the electrons strike the atoms with sufficient kinetic energy
to knock electrons out of them (Fig. 40.4 (ii)). This process is called
ionization by collision; the atoms become ions, and move towards the
cathode the extra electrons join the original ones in their flight to the
anode. At higher voltages the knocked-out electrons are accelerated
enough to produce more ions and electrons on the way (Fig. 40.4 (iii)).
Eventually a point is reached at which the current grows uncontrollably
the gas is said to break down. In practice, the current is limited by
a resistor, in series with the discharge tube; in a commercial neon
lamp this resistor, of resistance about 5000 ohms, is hidden in the base.
The current through a gas, like that through an electrolyte, is carried
by carriers of both signs positive and negative. At the anode, the

negative electrons enter the wires of the outside circuit, and eventually
come round to the cathode. There they meet positive ions, which they
now enter, and so re-form neutral gas atoms. Positive ions arriving at
the cathode knock off some of the atoms, which diffuse into the body of
the discharge, and there, eventually, they are ionized again. Thus a

amount of gas can carry a current indefinitely.
Once a gas has broken down, current can continue to pass through
it even in the dark: that is to say, when there is no ultra-violet light to
make the cathode emit electrons. The electrons from the cathode are
now simply knocked out of it by the violent bombardment of the
limited

positive ions.

Ultra-violet light is not, as a rule, necessary even for starting a
gaseous discharge. The somewhat mysterious cosmic rays, which reach
the earth from outer space, are able to ionize a gas they may therefore
enable a discharge to start. Once it has started, the emission of electrons
by bombardment of the cathode keeps it going.
;

Modern Production of Cathode Rays
The discharge tube method is not a convenient one for producing
and studying cathode rays or electrons. Firstly, a gas is needed at the
appropriate low pressure; secondly, a very high p.d. is needed across
the tube thirdly, X-rays are produced (p. 1068) which may be dangerous.
Nowadays a hot cathode is used to produce a supply of electrons.
This may consist of a fine tungsten wire, which is heated to a high
temperature when a low voltage source of 4-6 V is connected to it.
Metals contain free electrons, moving about rather like the molecules
;

a gas. If the temperature of the metal is raised, the thermal velocities
of the electrons will be increased. The chance of electrons escaping
from the attraction of the positive ions, fixed in the lattice, will then
also be raised. Thus by heating a metal such as tungsten to a high

Deflection in an Electric Field

Suppose a horizontal beam of electrons, moving with velocity v,
passes between two parallel plates, Fig. 40.8. If the p.d. between the
plates is V and their distance apart is d, the field intensity E = V/d.
Hence the force on an electron of charge e moving between the plates
= Ee = eV/d and is directed towards the positive plate.

Since the electric intensity E is vertical, no horizontal force acts on
the electron entering the plates. Thus the horizontal velocity, v, of the
beam is unaffected. This is similar to the motion of a projectile projected horizontally under gravity. The vertical acceleration due to
gravity does not affect the horizontal motion.

easier to distribute that direct current, because

electro-

battery-charging, and the operation of radio-receivers and
transmitters, however, direct current is essential. It can be obtained
lysis,

from an alternating current supply by means of a rectifier, which is a
device that will only pass current in one direction. A common type of
rectifier is that called a diode valve. It contains a metal filament, F in
Fig. 41.1 (a), surrounded by a metal anode A. The filament is heated by
a current drawn from a low voltage supply, and emits electrons. A
circuit for varying the anode potential is shown in Fig. 41.1 (a).

valve.

Since electrons are negative charges, such a device passes current when
anode is made positive with respect to its filament, but not when the
anode is made negative. Fig. 41.1 (b) shows the curve of anode current
against anode potential for a small diode; it is called the diode's
characteristic curve, or simply its characteristic. The current increases
with the positive anode potential as far as the point S. Beyond this
1009
its

ADVANCED LEVEL PHYSICS

point the current does not increase, because the anode is collecting
the electrons emitted by the filament; the current is said to be

all

saturated.

At first sight we might expect that any positive anode potential,
however small, would draw the full saturation current from the filament
to the anode. But it does not, because the charges on the electrons
make them repel one another. Thus the cloud of electrons between the
anode and filament repels the electrons leaving the filament, and turns
some of them back. The electrons round the filament are like the molecules in a cloud of vapour above a liquid they are continually escaping
from it and returning to it. The positive anode draws some away
from the cloud, as a wind carries water vapour away from a pool.
;

The wind, or

the anode, thins out the cloud, so that more electrons or
molecules escape than return. The higher the anode potential, the
fewer electrons return to the filament as the anode potential rises, the

current increases, to

its

saturation limit.

Some rectifying valves contain a little mercury vapour. When electrons flow through them, they ionize the mercury atoms, as explained
on p. 1016. The ions and electrons thus produced make the valve a very
good conductor, and reduce the voltage drop across it ; they therefore
allow more of the voltage from the transformer to appear across the
load.

A cathode-ray oscillograph,

we are about to describe, plots alternating potential difference

against time. It is so called because it traces the desired wave-form
with a beam of electrons, and beams of electrons were originally called
cathode rays.
A cathode-ray oscillograph is essentially an electrostatic instrument.
It consists of a highly evacuated glass tube, T in Fig. 41.4, one end of

which opens out to form a screen S which

is internally coated with
hot filament F, at the other end of the tube, emits
electrons. These are then attracted by the cylinders A t and A 2 which
have increasing positive potentials with respect to the filament. Many
of the electrons, however, shoot through the cylinders and strike the
screen where they do so, the zinc sulphide fluoresces in a green spot.
On their way to the screen, the electrons pass through two pairs of
metal plates, XX and YY, called the deflecting plates.

Deflection; Time-base
If a battery were connected between the Y-plates, so as to make the
upper one positive, the electrons in the beam would be attracted
towards that plate, and the beam would be deflected upwards. In the
same way, the beam can be deflected horizontally by a potential
difference applied between the X-plates. When the oscillograph is in
use, the alternating potential difference to be examined is applied
between the Y-plates. If that were all, then the spot would be simply
drawn out into a vertical line. To trace the wave-form of the alternating
potential difference, the X-plates are used to provide a time-axis. A
special valve circuit generates a potential difference which rises
steadily to a certain value, as shown in Fig. 41.5 (i), and then falls rapidly

it can be made to go through these changes tens, hundreds,

between the X-plates, so that the spot is swept steadily to the right,
and then flies swiftly back and starts out again. This horizontal motion

Fig. 41.6. Focusing in a C.R.O. tube.

Electrons entering the field from the filament experience forces from
at right angles to the equipotentials. They have,
however, considerable momentum, because they have been accelerated
by a potential difference of about 500 volts, and are travelling fast.
Consequently the field merely deflects them, and, because of its cylindrical symmetry, it converges the beam towards the point P. Before
they can reach this point, however, they enter the second cylinder.
Here the potential rises from the axis, and the electrons are deflected
outwards. However, they are now travelling faster than when they
were in the first cylinder, because the potential is everywhere higher.
Consequently their momentum is greater, and they are less deflected
than before. The second cylinder, therefore, diverges the beam less
than the first cylinder converged it, and the beam emerges from the
second anode still somewhat convergent. By adjusting the potential
of the first anode, the beam can be focused upon the screen, to give
a spot a millimetre or less in diameter.
Electron-focusing devices are called electron-lenses, or electronoptical systems. For example, the action of the anodes A x and A 2 is
roughly analogous to that of a pair of glass lenses on a beam of light, the
first glass lens being converging, and the second diverging, but weaker.

TRIODE VALVE — AMPLIFIER,
OSCILLATOR, DETECTOR
Triode Valve

A few years after the invention of the diode valve Lee de Forest
introduced the triode valve. This had three electrodes: a cathode C,
the emitter of electrons an anode A, the collector of electrons and a
grid G, a wire with open spaces, placed between the anode and cathode
(Fig. 41.8 (i)). The function of the grid is to control the electron flow
to the anode, and for this purpose the grid has a small negative potential
relative to the cathode. The grid is nearer the cathode than the anode,
and its potential thus affects the electric field round the cathode more,
with the result that the grid potential has a more delicate control than
the anode potential over the anode current. As we shall see later, this
enables the triode to act as an amplifier of alternating voltages as well
as a detector.

a negative voltage on the grid such as

volts creates a resultant negative electric intensity at the cathode,

and hence no electrons flow past the grid. As the negative voltage is
reduced and reaches a certain value the attractive effect of the positive
anode voltage overcomes the repulsive effect of the grid voltage, and
electrons now reach the anode. As the negative voltage is reduced
further, more electrons reach the anode, and the current increases as
shown. The general shape of the la -V curves is an initial curvature,

followed by a straight line.

The anode characteristics, I a-Va curves, are shown in Fig. 41.8 (iii),

the anode current increases. Generally, the anode current begins to flow

Triode as Voltage Amplifier

When a valve is used as a voltage amplifier in radio circuits, it is
important to realize at the outset that it amplifies alternating voltages,
and that these voltages are applied in the grid-cathode circuit, as

an increased alternating voltage V in the anode circuit, known
as the 'output voltage', but the waveform of V should be exactly the
same as V, the applied voltage, so that there is no distortion. In order
to obtain no distortion, a steady negative p.d. (grid-bias, G.B.) is also

will produce anode current variations corresponding to the straight part
of the characteristic. The anode or output current will then have a waveform exactly the same as the applied or input voltage V (Fig. 41.9 (ii)).
As we shall now show, the triode acts as a 'voltage amplifier' in this

Voltage Gain or Amplification Factor

The magnitude of the voltage amplification can be found by replacing
the valve circuit in Fig. 41.9 (i) by an 'equivalent A.C. circuit'. Since a
change of p.d. SV in the grid-cathode circuit is equivalent to a change
g

of fiSVg in the anode circuit, the alternating voltage Fis equivalent to an
alternating voltage fiVin the anode circuit. We therefore consider that,

between the anode and cathode, the valve is an alternating voltage
generator of e.m.f. fiV, with a internal resistance R a, the a.c. resistance
discussed on p. 1016. See Fig. 41.9 (iii).
To convert the alternating current in the anode circuit to an alternating voltage, a large resistance R is needed, of the order of thousands
of ohms. The internal resistance of the H.T. battery and that of the
G.B. battery can be neglected by comparison, and since varying
voltages are now considered, the magnitudes of the steady H.T. and
G.B. voltages can also be ignored. The complete valve equivalent a.c.

Basic Oscillatory Circuit

About 1862 Lord Kelvin showed theoretically that when an electrical
disturbance is made in a capacitor consisting of a capacitor and a coil
and then left, oscillations of current occur (see also p. 578). Thus

A coil-capacitor series circuit is

thus a basic oscillatory circuit, and the
frequency of the oscillations of charge (or current) depends on the
magnitudes of the inductance L and capacitance C.
The physical reason for the oscillations is the constant interchange of
energy between the capacitor and the coil. When the bob of a pendulum
is oscillating, its energy at the end of a swing is wholly potential.
This gradually changes into kinetic energy until it is wholly kinetic at
the middle of the swing, and then becomes potential energy again at
the end of the swing. In a similar way, the capacitor becomes fully
charged at one instant, the energy being electrostatic energy, and as the
capacitor discharges, the energy is stored in the magnetic field of the
coil. When the capacitor is fully discharged, the energy is wholly in
the magnetic field. After this, the capacitor charges up the other way
round, storing electrical energy, and when it is fully charged, there is
then no energy in the coil's magnetic field. See p. 578.

Damped and Undamped Waves
The oscillations of charge or current in a circuit containing only an
inductor and a capacitor will theoretically last indefinitely with a
constant amplitude (Fig. 41.12 (i)). In practice, however, some of the
energy is dissipated as heat in the resistance of the coil. Since this

Triode as an Oscillator

Fig. 41.13. Triode as oscillator.
When the circuit is made,
oscillations of current occur in the coil (L, i?)-capacitor (C) circuit, as
already explained. The oscillatory coil alternating p.d., across C, is
amplified by the valve, and oscillatory currents are then obtained in
bethe anode circuit and hence in the coil L v By mutual induction
tween the coils, some energy is fed back to the oscillator circuit. If the
feed-back is correctly phased and is of the required amount, it will
help to maintain the oscillations of current in the oscillatory current,
which will then become undamped. The magnitude and phase of the
feed-back can be varied by altering the position of the coil L 1 and, if
necessary, reversing its connections in the anode circuit. With audiofrequency oscillations, a continuous whistle can usually be heard.

Once the balance-wheel of a watch is set in motion, energy is imparted
it regularly only at certain times of its oscillation. In this way the
balance-wheel is supplied with the least amount of energy needed to
maintain undamped oscillations. For the same reason, the triode
oscillator circuit has a capacitor C and a high-resistance R in the
g
grid-circuit. See Fig. 41.13. When the circuit is first made the p.d. across
Rg is zero, and hence the grid is at zero potential. The alternating or
oscillatory voltage across the capacitor C makes the grid positive in
potential for some part of its cycle. Some electrons are therefore
drawn into the grid circuit, charging the capacitor C g During the
oscillatory voltage some charge (electrons) leaks away through R and

The

oscillations would then not continue owing to lack of feed-back of
energy.

Radio Waves and Modulation
In 1887 Hertz found by experiment that when an oscillatory voltage
of high frequency was connected to two capacitor plates far apart,
some of the oscillatory energy travelled in space some distance from
the plates and was detected. This was the first discovery of the existence
of radio waves.

(p. 1020) therefore usually produce alternating voltages of the order of a

Diode Valve Detection

The principle of the diode valve was discussed on p. 1009. There
we showed that a diode valve, which consists of a nickel plate or anode
placed in a vacuum opposite a cathode emitting electrons, allowed
current to flow through it only when the anode was positive in potential
relative to the cathode.

The diode can be used

to convert alternating to direct voltage (see

can also be used to 'detect' the audio-frequency variation
carried along with the modulated wave sent out by transmitters. If a
modulated wave is applied between the anode and cathode of a diode,
with a resistor R in the circuit (Fig. 41.16 (i)), the valve conducts on the
p. 1010). It

is the I A -VA curve. The average value of the current, it will be noted,
follows the variation of the amplitude of the modulated wave, and
hence the voltage across R, called the output voltage, has the same audiofrequency variation. In this way the diode is said to act as a 'detector'
of the audio-frequency. If the modulated wave were applied to the
resistance R without using the diode, the average current obtained
would be zero.

We have just shown that the diode can act as a 'detector' of the

with a steady grid-bias (G.B.) corresponding to a point on the bend

In receivers, the radio valve has been superseded by components
semiconductors, which perform the same function as the

and germanium are examples of semiconductor elements widely used

in

industry.

Electrons and Holes
Silicon and germanium atoms are tetravalent. They have four
electrons in their outermost shell, called valence electrons. One valence
electron is shared with each of four surrounding atoms in a tetrahedral

arrangement, forming 'covalent bonds' which maintain the crystalline
solid structure. Fig. 41.18 (i) is a two-dimensional representation of
the structure.

)

At OK, all the valence electrons are firmly bound to the nucleus
of their particular atom. At room temperature, however, the thermal
energy of a valence electron may become greater than the energy
binding it to its nucleus. The covalent bond is then broken. The electron
leaves the atom, X say, and becomes a free electron. This leaves X
with a vacancy or hole. Fig. 41.18 (ii). Since X now has a net positive
charge, an electron in a neighbouring atom may then be attracted.
Thus the hole appears to move to Y.
The hole movement through a semiconductor is random. But if
a battery is connected, the valence electrons are urged to move in one
direction and to fill the holes. The holes then drift in the direction of the
field. Thus the holes move as if they were carriers with a positive
charge + e, where e is the numerical value of the charge on an electron.
Fig. 41.18 (iii)- The current in the semiconductor is also carried by the
free electrons present. These are equal in number to the holes in a pure
semiconductor and drift in the opposite direction since they are
negative charges. The mobility of an electron, its average velocity per
unit electric field intensity, is usually much greater than that of a hole.
In electrolytes (p. 844), the current is also carried by moving negative
and positive charges but the carriers here are ions. It should be noted
that, in a pure semiconductor, there are equal numbers of electrons and
holes. Electron-hole pairs are said to be produced by the movement of
an electron from bound state in an atom to a higher energy level, where
it becomes a free electron.

VALVES, C.R.O. JUNCTION DIODE, TRANSISTORS

1025

Effect of Temperature Rise

In contrast to a semiconductor, the carriers of electricity in a metal
such as copper are only free electrons. Further, as the temperature
of the metal rises, the amplitude of vibration of the atoms increases
and more 'collisions' with atoms are then made by drifting electrons.
Thus, as stated on p. 837, the resistance of a pure metal increases with

temperature

rise.

In the case of a semiconductor, however, the increase in thermal
energy of the valence electrons due to temperature rise enables more
of them to break the covalent bonds and become free electrons. Thus
more electron-hole pairs are produced which can act as carriers of
current. Hence, in contrast to a pure metal, the electrical resistance of a
semiconductor decreases with temperature rise. This is one way of
distinguishing between a pure metal and a semiconductor.

P- and N-type Semiconductors

By 'doping' a semiconductor with a tiny amount of impurity such as
one part in a million, a considerable increase can be made to the number
of charge carriers.
Arsenic atoms, for example, have five electrons in their outermost or
valence band. When an atom of arsenic is added to a germanium
crystal, the atom settles in a lattice site with four of its electrons shared
with neighbouring germanium atoms. Fig. 41.19 (i). The fifth electron

may thus become free to wander through the crystal. Since an impurity
atom may provide one free electron, an enormous increase occurs in
the

number of electron carriers. The impure semiconductor is

where

n-semiconductor are electrons. Positive charges or holes are also
present in the n-semiconductor. These are thermally generated, as
previously explained, and since they are relatively few they are called

The impurity (arsenic) atoms are called donors
because they donate electrons as carriers.

the minority carriers.

In this case the reverse happens to that previously described. Each
atom at a lattice site attracts an electron from a neighbouring
atom, thereby completing the four valence bonds and forming a hole
in the neighbouring atom. Fig. 41.19 (ii). In this way an enormous
increase occurs in the number of holes. Thus in a p-semiconductor,
the majority carriers are holes or positive charges. The minority
carriers are electrons, negative charges, which are thermally generated.
The impurity atoms are called acceptors in this case because each
'accepts' an electron when the atom is introduced into the crystal.

concentration of scent molecules in the bottle causes the molecules to

1027

In a similar way, an excess positive charge B builds up in the nsemiconductor when holes diffuse across the junction. Together with the
negative charge A on the p-side, an e.m.f. or p.d. is produced which
opposes the diffusion of charges across the junction. This is called a
barrier p.d. and when the flow ceases it has a magnitude of a few tenths
of a volt.

Junction Diode

When a battery B, with an e.m.f. greater than the barrier p.d., is
joined with its positive pole to the p-semiconductor, P, and its negative
pole to the n-semiconductor, N, p-charges (holes) are urged across the
p-n junction from P to
and n-charges (electrons) from
to P.
Fig. 41.21 (i). Thus an appreciable current is obtained. The p-n junction
is now said to he forward-biased, and when the applied p.d. is increased,
the current increases.

It can now be seen that the p-n junction acts as a rectifier. It has a
low resistance for one direction of p.d. and a high resistance for the
opposite direction, as shown by the characteristic curve in Fig. 41.21 (iii).
It is therefore called a junction diode. The junction diode has advantages
over a diode valve for example, it needs only a low voltage battery B to
function; it does not need time to warm up; it is less bulky, and it is
cheaper to manufacture in large numbers. On this account, the junction
diode has replaced the diode valve in receivers.

The Transistor

The junction diode is a component which can only rectify. The
is a more useful component; it is a current amplifier. A
transistor is made from three layers of p- and n-semiconductors. They
are called respectively the emitter (E), base (B) and collector (C). Fig.

Although the action of n-p-n transistors is similar in principle to
p-n-p transistors, the carriers of the current in the former case are
mainly electrons and in the latter case holes. Electrons are more
speedy carriers than holes (p. 1024). Thus n-p-n transistors are used in
high-frequency circuits, where the carriers are required to respond
very quickly to signals.

input characteristics and transfer characteristic in the common-emitter
(C-E) arrangement. The results are shown in Fig. 41.28 (i), (ii), (iii).
Output characteristic. Since the knee of the curve occurs at a low
voltage of the order of 1 V, only low battery supply voltages are needed
to operate a transistor in the linear region beyond the knee. This is an
advantage of the transistor compared with the valve. Further, the small
slope of the straight line shows that the output resistance is high. Thus
although the load in the collector circuit may vary, the collector current
is constant for a given alternating input or base current. Hence the
transistor can be considered as a constant current generator in circuitry,
whereas the triode valve is treated as a constant voltage generator
with a given input (p. 1017).

C-E arrangement, since ICE0 also flows in the base-emitter circuit
when the transistor is operating. A temperature change from 25°C to
45°C, which would increase the current 7CE0 by 10 fiA say, would
thus be amplified to about 49 x 10 juA or 490 fiA, if/? is 49. This increase
in current, nearly 0-5 mA, would have a considerable effect on the
output in the collector circuit, and it would lead to a distorted output,
for example.
On the other hand, a = 0-98 for the same transistor. Thus in the C-B
arrangement, a similar temperature rise and current increase of 10 fiA
would produce a change in 0-98 x 10 ptA, or nearly 10 //A, in the output
or collector circuit. This is only a very small change compared to the
C-E case. On this account the C-E arrangement, which is very sensitive
to temperature change, must be stabilized for excessive temperature
rise. Silicon transistors are much less sensitive to temperature change
than germanium transistors and are hence becoming used more widely.

Thermistor
There are numerous semiconductor devices other than the transistor. A
is a heat-sensitive resistor usually made from semiconductor materials
which have a high negative temperature coefficient of resistance. Its resistance
thus decreases appreciably with temperature rise.
One use of a thermistor is to safeguard against current surges in circuits
where this could be harmful, for example, in a circuit where the heaters of radio

When

the supply voltage is switched on, the thermistor has a high resisbecause it is cold. It thus limits the current to a moderate value.
As it warms up, the thermistor resistance drops appreciably and an increased

Fig. 41.33 shows a circuit in which a Mullard phototransistor ocp71 is connected in series with a relay coil
and a d.c. supply voltage. When the phototransistor is illuminated, the increase in collector current closes the contacts of a
magnetic relay. Current then flows in a circuit connected to the relay, and a bell,
for example, may then ring. Fig. 41.33. When the light is switched off, the falling
current in the relay coil produces an induced voltage in the same direction as the
battery supply. This would raise the collector voltage and prevent the switch-off
at the contacts. The diode oa81 across the coil acts as a safeguard. As soon as the
rising induced voltage becomes equal to the battery voltage the diode conducts,

Radioactivity.

The Nucleus

In 1896 Becquerel found that a uranium compound affected a photographic plate wrapped in light-proof paper. He called the phenomenon
radioactivity, and we shall see later that natural radioactivity is due to
one or more of three types of radiation emitted from heavy elements
such as uranium. These were originally called a-, /?- and y-rays but
a- and ft- 'rays' were soon shown to be actually particles.
a- and /^-particles and y-rays all produce ionization as they move
through a gas. On average, a-particles produce about 1000 times as
many ions per unit length of their path as ^-particles, which in turn
produce about 1000 times as many ions as y-rays. There are numerous
detectors of ionizing radiations such as a- and j8-particles and y-rays.
We begin by describing two detectors used in laboratories.

Dekatron Counter. Ratemeter

As we have seen, each ionizing particle or radiation produces a pulse
voltage in the external circuit of a Geiger-Muller or solid state detector.
In order to measure the number of pulses from the detectors, some
form of counter must be used.

A dekatron counter consists of two or

tenth pulse, which returns the first counter to zero, a pulse is sent to
the second tube. The glow here then moves on one place. The second
tube thus counts the number of tens of pulses. After ten pulses are sent
to the second tube, corresponding to a count of 100, the output pulse

counts units, to advance one

thousands and so on. Dekatron tubes are used
in radioactive experiments because they can respond to a rate of about
1000 counts per second. This is greatly in excess of the count rate
possible with a mechanical counter.
In contrast to a scaler, which counts the actual number of pulses,
a ratemeter is a device which provides directly the average number of
pulses per second or count rate. The principle is shown in Fig. 42.4. The

discharge current is recorded on a microammeter A. The greater the
rate at which the pulses arrive, the greater will be the meter reading. The
meter thus records a current which is proportional to the count rate.
If a large capacitor C is used, it will take a long time to charge and
the pulses will be averaged over a long time.

A

constant' on most ratemeters allows the magnitude of C to be chosen.
If a large value of C is used, the capacitor will take a relatively long time
to charge and correspondingly it will be a long time before a reading
can be taken. The reading obtained, however, will be more accurate
since the count rate is then averaged over a longer time (see below).
For high accuracy, a small value of C may be used only if the count

very high.

Errors in Counting Experiments

Radioactive decay is random in nature (p. 1048). If the count rate is
it is not necessary to wait so long before readings are obtained
which vary relatively slightly from each other. If the count rate is low,
successive counts will have larger percentage differences from each other,
unless a much longer counting time is employed.
The accuracy of a count does not depend on the time involved but on
the total count obtained. If
counts are received, the statistics of
random processes show that this is subject to a statistical error of

Existence of

The

existence of different ionizing particles or radiations from
radioactive substances can be shown by an absorption experiment,

using a counter or ratemeter.
A radium source S, producing a- and /^-particles and y-rays, is placed
at a fixed small distance from a solid state detector A and sensitive
low-noise pre-amplifier, which is connected to a counter C (or ratemeter) (Fig. 42.5 (i) ). Foils of increasing thickness are placed over the

beyond this point the curve does not then fall off with distance as

absorbed at a particular thickness of aluminium plate, leaving another
radiation, the y-rays. This straightforward experiment shows the
existence of three different types of radiation, a- and 0-particles and
y-rays.

It is found that a-particles have a fairly definite range in air at
atmospheric pressure. This can be shown by slowly increasing the
distance between a pure a-source and a detector. The count rate is
observed to fall rapidly to zero at a separation greater than a particular
value, which is called the 'range' of the a-particles. The range depends

on

the source

and on the

air pressure.

Using the apparatus of Fig. 42.6, it can be shown the a-particles are positively
charged. When there is no magnetic field, the solid state detector is placed so that

Nature of a-particle

Lord Rutherford and his collaborators found by deflection experiments than an a-particle had a mass about four times that of a hydrogen
atom, and carried a charge +2e, where e was the numerical value
of the charge on an electron. The atomic
weight of helium is about four. It was thus
fairly certain that an a-particle was a helium
nucleus, that is, a helium atom which has lost
two electrons.
In 1909 Rutherford and Royds showed

which emits a-particles, was collected above

Using a Ticonal bar magnet, it can be shown that /^-particles are
strongly deflected by a magnetic field. The direction of the deflection
corresponds to a stream of negatively-charged particles, that is,
opposite to the deflection of a-particles in the same field. This is con-

Thus the number N of radioactive atoms left decreases exponentially

The half-life period T1/2 of a radioactive element is defined as the time

Wflson's Cloud Chamber
C. T. R. Wilson's cloud chamber, invented in 1911, was one of the
most useful early inventions for studying radioactivity. It enabled
photographs to be obtained of ionizing particles or radiation.

formation. The drops are photographed by light scattered from them,

and

way the tracks of ionizing particles or radiation are made
Wilson's cloud chamber has proved of immense value in the
studv of radioactivity and nuclear structure.
The random nature of radioactive decay can be seen by using a
Wilson cloud chamber. Particles emitted by a radioactive substance
do not appear at equal intervals of time but are sporadic or entirely
random. The length of the track of an emitted particle is a measure of
its initial energy. The tracks of a-particles are nearly all the same,

Sometimes two different lengths of tracks are obtained, showing that

same way as air can be super-saturated with water vapour, a
under pressure can be heated to a temperature higher than that
at which boiling normally takes place and is then said to be superheated.
If the pressure is suddenly released, bubbles may not form in the
liquid for perhaps 30 seconds or more. During this quiet period, if
ionizing particles or radiation are introduced into the liquid, nuclei
are obtained for bubble formation. The liquid quickly evaporates into
the bubble, which grows rapidly, and the bubble track when photographed shows the path of the ionizing particle.
Glaser invented the bubble chamber in 1951. It is now widely used in
nuclear investigations all over the world, and it is superior to the cloud
chamber. The density of the liquid ensures shorter tracks than in air,
so that a nuclear collision of interest by a particle will be more likely to
take place in a given length of liquid than in the same length of air.
Photographs of the tracks are much clearer than those taken in the cloud
chamber, and they can be taken more rapidly. In 1963 a 1-5 metre liquid
hydrogen bubble chamber was constructed for use at the Rutherford
High Energy Laboratory, Didcot, England. High energy protons,
accelerated by millions of volts are used to bombard hydrogen nuclei in
the chamber. The products of the reaction are bent into a curved track
by a very powerful magnetic field, and the appearance and radius of the
track then provides information about the nature, momentum or

Special photographic emulsions have been designed for investigating nuclear reactions. The emulsions are much thicker than those
used in ordinary photography, and the concentration of silver brois many times greater than in ordinary photography,
protons and neutrons can be detected in specially-prepared
emulsions by the track of silver granules produced, which has usually
a very short range of the order of a millimetre or less. Consequently,
after the plate is developed the track is observed under a high power
microscope, or a photomicrograph is made. Nuclear emulsions were
particularly useful in investigations of cosmic rays at various altitudes.

of a-particles were scattered through small angles, some particles were
scattered through very large angles. Rutherford found this very exciting
news. It meant that some a-particles had come into the repulsive field
of a highly concentrated positive charge at the heart or centre of the
atom, and on the basis of an inverse-square law repulsion he calculated
the number of a-particles scattered in a definite direction. The relationship was verified by Geiger and Marsden in subsequent experiments.

Atomic Mass and Atomic Number
In 1911 Rutherford proposed the basic structure of the atom which

others have confirmed. A neutral atom consists of a very tiny nucleus

cm which contains practically the whole

mass of the atom. The atom is largely empty. If a drop of water was
magnified until it reached the size of the earth, the atoms inside would
then be only a few metres in diameter and the atomic nucleus would
have a diameter of only about 10~ 2 millimetre.
The nucleus of hydrogen is called a proton, and it carries a charge of
+ e, where e is the numerical value of the charge on an electron. The
helium nucleus has a charge of +2e. The nucleus of copper has a
charge of + 29e, and the uranium nucleus carries a charge of + 92e\
Generally, the positive charge on a nucleus is +Ze, where Z is the
atomic number of the element and is defined as the number of protons
in the nucleus (see also p. 1072). Under the attractive influence of the
positively-charged nucleus, a number of electrons equal to the atomicnumber move round the nucleus and surround it like a negativelycharged cloud.

Discovery of Neutron in Nucleus
In 1930 Bothe and Becker found that a very penetrating radiation
was produced when a-particles were incident on beryllium. Since the
radiation had no charge it was thought to be y-radiation of very
great energy. In 1932 Curie- Joliot placed a block of paraffin-wax in
front of the penetrating radiation, and showed that protons of considerable range were ejected from the paraffin-wax. The energy of the
radiation could be calculated from the range of the ejected proton,
and it was then found to be improbably high.
In 1932 Chad wick measured the velocity of protons and of nitrogen
nuclei when they were ejected from materials containing hydrogen and
nitrogen by the penetrating radiation. He used polonium, A, as a
source of a-particles and the unknown radiation X, obtained by impact
with beryllium, B, was then incident on a slab C of paraffin-wax (Fig.

the equations obtained, he calculated the mass of the particle, and found
it to be about the same mass as the proton. Chadwick called the new
particle a neutron, and it is now considered that all nuclei contain protons and neutrons. The neutron is represented by the symbol £n as
it has an atomic mass of 1 and zero charge.
We can now see that a helium nucleus, *He, has 2 protons and 2

Radioactive Disintegration

Naturally occurring radioactive elements such as uranium, actinium

and thorium disintegrate to form new elements, and these in turn are
unstable and form other elements. Between 1902 and 1909 Rutherford
and Soddy made a study of the elements formed from a particular
'parent' element, and the uranium series is listed in the table below.

The new element formed after disintegration can be identified by
considering the particles emitted from the nucleus of the parent atom.
An a-particle, a helium nucleus, has a charge of + 2e and a mass number
4. Uranium I, of atomic number 92 and mass number 238, emits an
a-particle from its nucleus of charge + 92e, and hence the new nucleus
formed has an atomic number 90 and a mass number 234. This was

/7-particle has a charge of — e. Now uranium X has a nuclear charge of
x
+90e and a mass number 234, and emits fi and y rays. Consequently
the mass number is unaltered, but the nuclear charge increases to +91e,
and hence a new element is formed of atomic number 91. This is
uranium X 2 in the series, and is actually the element protactinium.
The symbols of the new elements formed are shown in brackets in the
column of elements in the Table. The series contains isotopes of
uranium (U) 2 lead (Pb), thorium (Th) and bismuth (Bi), that is, elements
which have the same atomic numbers but different mass numbers (see

Summarizing, we can say that
(i) when the nucleus of an element loses an a-particle, the element is
displaced two places to the left in the periodic table of the elements,
which follows in the order of its atomic number, and lowers its mass

number by two units
(ii) when the nucleus

of an element loses a ^-particle, the element is
displaced one place to the right in the periodic table and its mass
number is unaltered.

This law was stated in 1913 by Soddy, Russell and Fajans.

Consequently any hydrogen ions present would produce the outermost
parabola H, since they have the greatest value of Q/M. The masses of ions
can thus be measured by comparing the squares of the x-values of the
individual parabolas, such as the squares of X'X and H'H, for example.
In this way Thomson obtained a mass spectrometer, one which gave
the masses of individual atoms.
With chlorine gas, two parabolas were obtained which gave atomic
masses of 35 and 37 respectively. Thus the atoms of chlorine have different masses but the same chemical properties, and these atoms are said
to be isotopes of chlorine. In chlorine, there are three limes as many atoms
of mass 35 as there are of mass 37, so that the average atomic weight is
(3x35+1 x 37)/4, or 355. The element xenon has as many as nine
isotopes. One part in 5000 of hydrogen consists of an isotope of mass 2
called deuterium, or heavy hydrogen. An unstable isotope of hydrogen of
mass 3 is called tritium.

Mass Spectrometer

Thomson's earliest form of mass spectrometer was followed by
more sensitive forms. In 1933 Bainbridge devised a mass spectrometer in which the ions were photographed after being deflected
by a magnetic field. The principle of the spectrometer is shown in
42.24. Positive ions were
produced in a discharge tube

Since the ions strike the photographic plate at a distance 2r from the
middle of the slit S 3 , it follows that the separation of ions carrying the
same charge is directly proportional to their mass. Thus a 'linear'
mass scale is achieved. A resolution of 1 in 30000 was obtained with a
later type of spectrometer.
Einstein's

In 1905 Einstein showed from his Theory of Relativity that mass
and energy can be changed from one form to the other. The energy E
produced by a change of mass m is given by the relation

Thermonuclear Reaction

The binding energy curve in Fig. 42.23 shows that elements with low
atomic mass, up to about 56, can produce energy by fusion of their
nucleons. For fusion to take place, the nuclei must at least overcome
their nuclear repulsion when approaching each other.
Consequently,
for practical purposes, fusion reactions can best be achieved

with the
elements such as hydrogen, whose nuclei carry the smallest
charges and hence repel each other least.
In attempts to obtain fusion, isotopes of hydrogen such as deuterium,
iH, and tritium, f H, are heated to tens of millions of degrees centigrade. The thermal energy of the nuclei at these high temperatures
is sufficient for fusion to occur. One technique of
promoting this thermonuclear reaction is to pass enormously high currents through the gas,
which heat it. A very high percentage of the atoms are then ionized and
the name plasma is given to the gas. Interstellar space or the aurora
borealis contains a weak form of plasma, but the interior of stars
contains a highly concentrated form of plasma. The gas discharge
lightest

consists of parallel currents, carried
field

round one current due

to

by ions, and the powerful magnetic
a neighbouring current (see p. 939) draws

the discharge together. This is the so-called 'pinch effect'. The plasma,
however, wriggles and touches the sides of the containing vessel, thereby losing heat. The main difficulty in thermonuclear experiments in the
laboratory is to retain the heat in the gas for a sufficiently long time for
a fusion reaction to occur, and the stability of plasma is now the
subject of considerable research.
It is believed that the energy of the sun is produced
by thermonuclear reactions in the heart of the sun, where the temperature is

many

millions of degrees centigrade. Bethe has proposed a cycle
of nuclear reactions in which, basically, protons are converted to
helium by fusion, with the liberation of a considerable amount of
energy.

X-rays

In 1895, Rontgen found that some photographic

plates,

kept care-

wrapped in his laboratory, had become fogged. Instead of merely
throwing them aside he set out to find the cause of the fogging. He
traced it to a gas-discharge tube, which he was using with a low pressure
and high voltage. This tube appeared to emit a radiation that could
penetrate paper, wood, glass, rubber, and even aluminium a centimetre
and a half thick. Rontgen could not find out whether the radiation
was a stream of particles or a train of waves Newton had the same
difficulty with light
and he decided to call it X-rays.

Nature and Production of X-rays

We now regard X-rays as waves, similar to light waves, but of much
shorter wavelength: about 10~ 8 cm, or 1 Angstrom unit. They are
produced when fast electrons, or cathode rays, strike a target, such as
the walls or anode of a low-pressure discharge tube. In a modern X-ray
tube there is no gas, or as little as high-vacuum technique can achieve
"
the pressure is about 10 5
Hg. The electrons are provided by
thermionic emission from a white-hot tungsten filament (p. 999). In

mains, transformers provide about 10 volts for heating the filament,
and about 100 000 volts for accelerating the electrons. On the half-

when the target is positive, the electrons bombard it, and
generate X-rays. On the half-cycles when the target is negative,
nothing happens at all there is too little gas in the tube for it to
break down. Thus the tube acts, in effect, as its own rectifier (p. 1010),
providing pulses of direct current between target and filament. The
heat generated at the target by the electronic bombardment is so great
cycles

—

that the target must be cooled artificially. In the figure, fins for aircooling are shown, but in large tubes the target is made hollow, and is
cooled by circulating water or oil. The target in an X-ray tube is usually
tungsten, which has a high melting-point.

be taken, with the plate in place of the screen. In this way cracks and
flaws can be detected in metal castings.
When X-rays are passed through a crystal, they are scattered by its

atoms and diffracted, as light is by a diffraction grating (p. 707). By
recording the diffraction pattern on a photographic plate, and measuring it up, the structure of the crystal can be discovered. This was
developed by Sir William Bragg and his son, Sir Lawrence Bragg.
X-ray Spectra
In an X-ray tube, very energetic electrons bombard atoms in a
metal target such as tungsten, and an electron may be ejected from
the innermost shell, the
shell. The atom is then in an excited state

K

unstable. If an electron from the L shell now moves into the
vacancy in the
shell, the energy of the atom is decreased and simultaneously there is emission of radiation. If £ is the change in energy

Thus v = E/h, and as £ is very high for metals, the frequency v is

The

proof of the wave-nature of X-rays was due to Laue in
years after X-rays were discovered. He suggested that the
regular small spacing of atoms in crystals might provide a natural
diffraction grating if the wavelengths of the rays were too short to be
used with an optical line grating. Experiments by Friedrich and Knipping showed that X-rays were indeed diffracted by a thin crystal, and
produced a pattern of intense spots round a central image on a photographic plate placed to receive them (Fig. 43.2). The rays had thus

Law

The study

of the atomic structure of crystals by X-ray analysis

was

William Bragg and his son Sir Lawrence Bragg,
with notable achievements. They soon found that a monochromatic
beam of X-rays was reflected from a plane in the crystal rich in atoms,
a so-called atomic plane, as if the latter acted like a mirror.
This important effect can be explained by Huyghens's wave theory
in the same way as the reflection of light by a plane surface. Suppose
a monochromatic parallel X-ray beam is incident on a crystal and
in an atomic plane P (Fig.
interacts with atoms such as A, B, C,
43.3 (i)). Each atom scatters the X-rays. Using Huyghens's construction,
wavelets can be drawn with the atoms as centres, which all lie on a plane

wavefront reflected at an equal angle to the atomic plane P. When
the X-ray beam penetrates the crystal to other atomic planes such as
Q, R parallel to P, reflection occurs in a similar way (Fig. 43.3 (ii)).
Usually, the beam or ray reflected from one plane is weak in intensity.
If, however, the reflected beams or rays from all planes are in phase with
each other, an intense reflected beam is produced by the crystal.
Suppose, then, that the glancing angle on an atomic plane in the
crystal is 0, and d is the distance apart of consecutive parallel atomic
planes (Fig. 43.3 (ii)). The path difference between the rays marked (1)

is

reflected

when
2d sin

=

nX,

where X

is the wavelength and n has integral values. This is known as
Bragg's law. Hence, as the crystal is rotated so that the glancing angle
is increased from zero, and the beam reflected at an equal angle is
observed each time, an intense beam is suddenly produced for a glancing
angle X such that 2d sin X = X. When the crystal is rotated further,
an intense reflected beam is next obtained for an angle 2 when 2d sin
2
= 2X. Thus several orders of diffraction images may be observed.
Many orders are obtained if X is small compared with 2d. Conversely,
no images are obtained if X is greater than 2d.
The intense diffraction (reflection) images from an X-ray tube are due
to X-ray lines characteristic of the metal used as the target, or 'anticathode' as it was originally known. This is because the quantum of
energy hv in the emitted X-ray depends on the nuclear charge + Ze of
the atom, which affects electron energy changes near the nucleus
(p. 1084). The frequency, or wavelength X, thus depends on the atomic
number, Z.

X-ray Analysis

A

form of spectrometer was designed by Sir William Bragg
The crystal was fixed on the table, and an X-ray
beam, limited by lead shields A, B, was incident on the crystal at various
glancing angles,
(Fig. 43.4 (i)). An ionization chamber, Q, was used
to measure the intensity of the X-rays reflected by the crystal.
Q
contained a heavy gas such as methyl iodide, and the intensity of the

was measured by means of an electrometer (not shown) connected
to Q. The table and

turned through twice the
angle of rotation of the crystal, and was always ready to measure the
intensity of X-rays satisfying the law 2d sin 9 — nX.
Typical results with particular parallel atomic planes in a crystal such
as sylvine (KC1) or rocksalt (NaCl) are shown roughly in Fig. 43.4 (ii).
A characteristic X-ray line such as a produces peaks of intensity at
glancing angles 9 X 9 2 and 6 3 for the first three orders. Measurement

where

a, b are constants.
Since the regularity of the graph was so marked, Moseley predicted
the discovery of elements with atomic numbers 43, 61, 72 and 75, which
were missing from the graph at that time. These were later discovered.
He also found that though the atomic weights of iron, nickel and cobalt
increased in this order, their positions from the graph were: iron
(Z = 26), cobalt (Z = 27) and nickel (Z = 28). The chemical properties
of the three elements agree with the order by atomic number and not by
atomic weight. Rutherford's experiments on the scattering of a-particles

(p.

1050)

showed

that the

atom contained a

central nucleus of charge

+ Ze where Z is the atomic number, and Moseley's experiments confirm
the importance of Z in atomic theory (see also p. 1090).

of Matter

Electrons are not the only particles which behave as waves. The
with more massive particles because their
momenta are generally much higher, and so the wavelength is correspondingly shorter. Since appreciable diffraction is observed only when
the wavelength is of the same order as the grating spacing, the heavier
particles, such as protons, are diffracted much less. Slow neutrons,
however, are used in diffraction experiments, since the low velocity
and high mass combine to give a momentum similar to that of electrons
used in electron diffraction. The wave nature of a-particles is important

PARTICLE NATURE OF WAVES

We have already seen that y-rays behave as electromagnetic waves
of very short wavelength. Now y-rays can be detected by GeigerMiiller (GM) tubes and solid state detectors, where individual pulses
are counted. Thus, on detection, y-rays behave as particles. Other
evidence for the particle nature of electromagnetic waves is given by
the photoelectric effect, which we now discuss.
Photoelectricity

In 1888 Hallwachs discovered that an insulated zinc plate, negatively
charged, lost its charge if exposed to ultra-violet light. Hertz had
previously noticed that a spark passed more easily across the gap of an
induction coil when the negative metal terminal was exposed to
sunlight. Later investigators such as Lenard and others showed that
electrons were ejected

from a zinc plate when exposed to

ultra-violet

Light thus gives energy to the electrons in the surface atoms
of the metal, and enables them to break through the surface. This is
light.

(i) is

a diagram of a modern photoelectric cell. The cathode

K is a V -shaped plate coated with caesium or some more complicated
and very sensitive surface. In front of it is a wire ring, the anode A,
which collects the photo-electrons. The heavy curve at (ii) in the figure
shows how the current through the cell, /, varies with the potential
difference across it, V. At first the current rises, but at a potential
difference of about 30 volts is saturates. We suppose that the anode
is then collecting all the electrons emitted by the cathode. This curve
is drawn for a light-flux of 1 lumen upon the cathode (p. 562). If the
flux is halved, the saturation current also falls by a half, showing that

number

of electrons emitted per second is proportional to the
upon the cathode.
Some photoelectric cells contain an inert gas such as argon at
a pressure of a few millimetres of mercury. The current in such a cell
does not saturate, because the electrons ionize the gas atoms by
collision. Fig. 43.10 (ii). The greater the potential difference, the greater
the kinetic energy of the electrons, and the more intense the ionization
of the gas.
Photoelectric cells are used in photometry, in industrial control and
counting operations, in television, and in many other ways. Their use
in reproducing sound from film is explained in the Sound section of

about 100 ohms, varies with the light-flux falling upon it. The current
is not quite proportional to the flux. Photo-voltaic cells are obviously

Velocity of Photo-electrons

In 1902 Lenard found that the velocity of ejection of the electron
from an illuminated metal was independent of the intensity of the
particular incident monochromatic light. It appeared to vary only with
the wavelength or frequency of the incident light, and above a particular
wavelength no electrons were emitted. This was a very surprising
result. It could not be explained on classical grounds, which predicts
that the greater the light energy incident on the metal, the greater

should be the energy of the liberated electrons, and that electrons
should always be ejected, irrespective of the incident wavelength, if the
incident energy is large enough.
Theories of Light.

The Photon

About 1660 Newton had proposed a corpuscular theory of light,
that is, light consists of particles or corpuscles, and he explained the
phenomena of reflection and refraction by applying the laws of mech-

About the same period Huyghens

proposed a wave theory of light, that is, light travels by the propagation
of a wave or disturbance in the medium (p. 676), and this was applied
with particular success to the phenomena of interference and diffraction.

In 1902 Planck

had shown that the experimental observations in
black-body radiation could be explained on the basis that the energy
from the body was emitted in separate or discrete packets of energy,
known as quanta of energy, of amounts hv, where v is the frequency of
the radiation and h is a constant known as Planck's constant. This is
the quantum theory of radiation. With characteristic genius, Einstein
asserted in 1905 that the unexpected experimental result of Lenard
that the energy of the ejected electron was independent of the intensity
of the incident light and depended only on the frequency of the light
could be explained by applying a quantum theory of light. He assumed
that light of frequency v contains packets or quanta of energy hv. On

The metal, A say, was kept at a variable positive potential by a
battery H, and illuminated by a beam of monochromatic light of wavelength X x from a spectrometer. Any photo-electrons emitted could reach
a gauze cylinder G, which was connected to one side of an electrometer
E whose other terminal was earthed, and a current / would then flow in
E. When the potential of A is increased, G has an increasing negative
potential relative to A, — V say, and the current J then decreases. At
some negative value, —Vlt the current becomes zero (Fig. 43.14 (i)). The
potential of G is then the same as the other terminal of E, which is
earthed, and the negative potential of G relative to A is thus now
given numerically by the p.d. of the battery H. Millikan obtained
variations of current, J, with monochromatic light of other wavelengths

Duality

From what

has been said, it is clear that particles can exhibit wave
and that waves can sometimes behave as particles. It would
appear, therefore, that a paradox exists since wave and particle structure
appear mutually exclusive.
Scientists gradually realized, however, that the dual aspect of waveproperties,

particle properties are completely

general in nature. All physical

can be described either as waves or particles; the description
to choose is entirely a matter of convenience. The two aspects, wave
and particle, are linked through the two relations

The results of the Franck-Hertz experiment show that the energy of
an atom is constant unless the atom is given enough energy to raise
this by a definite amount. No intermediate energy change is allowed.
An atom, therefore, exists in one of a set of well defined energy levels.
If helium, for example, is used in a Franck-Hertz tube, a graph shown
in Fig. 43.15 (iii) is obtained. Here each peak corresponds to a different
energy level of the atom. Thus a whole sequence of different energy
levels can be found in the helium atom.
As we have seen, at ordinary temperatures, the thermal energy of
molecules in a gas is insufficient to cause excitation. If the gas can be
heated to an enormously high temperature, of the order of 100 000 K.
the molecules can gain enough energy to cause excitation.
Energy Levels

in Spectra

a gas is excited by a high voltage to produce a discharge, and the
examined in a spectrometer, an emission spectrum is seen.
A number of gases such as neon produce a line spectrum, that is, the
spectrum consists of a number of well defined lines, each having a
particular wavelength or frequency. These lines are also experimental
evidence for the existence of separate or 'quantized' energy levels in
the atom, as we now explain.
As they move through the discharge in the gas, some electrons have
sufficient energy to excite atoms to a higher energy level. We suppose
that a given atom has a series of defined and discrete (separated)
energy levels of the atom, E ,E X E 2 and that no other or intermediate
energy level is possible. The lowest energy level E is called the ground

Bohr's Theory of Hydrogen

Atom

A model of the hydrogen atom was proposed by Bohr in 1911. This
explained satisfactorily the existence of energy levels and the spectrum
of the hydrogen atom. Later, however, it was shown that the model
could not be applied to other atoms and a more satisfactory 'quantum
theory' of the atom has since been developed.

this means that the hydrogen atom then loses an electron completely

If the electron can behave as a wave, it must be possible to fit a

atom, can pass from one allowed energy level E x to another E 2 of

Excitation and Ionization Potentials

Bohr's theory of the hydrogen atom was unable to predict the energy
complex atoms, which had many electrons. Quantum or wave
mechanics, beyond the scope of this book, is used to explain the spectral
frequencies of these atoms. The fundamental ideas of Bohr's theory,
however, are still retained, for example, the angular momentum of the
electron has quantum values and the energy levels of the atom have
only allowed discrete values.
Generally, an atom is most stable when it has a minimum energy
E and it is then said to be in its ground state (p. 1084). If the atom

more closely spaced at the higher excited states. Beyond the value
E^, when the ejected electron is no longer under the attractive influence
of the nucleus, the energy of the 'free' electron, \mv 2 , can have one of
a continuous range of energies, whereas inside the atom it could only
have one of a number of separated allowed values.

Emission spectra are classified into continuous, line and band spectra.
With few exceptions, incandescent solids and liquids produce a continuous spectrum, one in which all wavelengths are found over a wide

a discharge tube, and the spectrum of a sodium salt vaporized
a Bunsen flame consists of two lines close together. Gases such as
carbon dioxide in a discharge tube also produce a band spectrum, each
band consisting of a series of lines very close together at the sharp edge
or head of the band and farther apart at the other end or tail. Band
spectra are essentially due to molecules. The different band heads in a
band system are due to small allowed discrete energy changes in the
vibrational states of the molecule. The fine lines in a given band are
due to still smaller allowed discrete energy changes in the rotational

states of the molecule.

Limitations of Bohr's

Theory— Quantum Theory

The Bohr theory predicts successfully the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, as we have just seen. There are, however, some details of the
spectrum which are not explained. When the radiating atoms are
placed in a magnetic field each energy level splits into a number of
energy levels near to the main energy level. This causes the spectral
lines to split and is known as the Zeeman effect. The full quantum
theory predicts this behaviour and utilizes four quantum numbers
1. Principal quantum number, n. This specifies the main energy level
and corresponds to the number n in the Bohr theory.
n — 1, and
2. Orbital quantum number,
This can take values 0, 1,
specifies the angular momentum of the electron. In the Bohr theory, one
value of angular momentum corresponds to one value of energy. In
quantum theory there are n values of / corresponding to the principal
quantum number n. For n = 1, the ground state, quantum theory
states that the angular momentum is zero, unlike the Bohr theory.
— (/— 1)
3. Magnetic quantum number, m. This can take values —
I.

A

Pauli Exclusion Principle

PaulVs exclusion principle is needed in describing the electron
configuration of multi-electron atoms. It states that no two electrons
in an atom can have the same set offour quantum numbers. In the lowest
energy level, n = 1 and hence I = 0. This in turn restricts the value of
m to zero. ms however, may take either of its two values ±% and so
there are two electron states with n = 1. These two electrons form a
shell. The two electrons in the shell have energy levels which are very

its outermost shell, that is, it is an electron donor on the other hand,
the chlorine atom can accommodate 1 more electron in its outermost
shell, that is, it is an electron acceptor. When the very stable compound sodium chloride is formed, the outer electron in the sodium
atom passes to the chlorine atom. The outermost shells of each atom

chlorine (K = 2, L = 8,

contrast, helium (K = 2 electrons), and neon (K = 2, L = 8 electrons)

PREFACE
This book is based on an honors course in advanced calculus that we gave in the
1960's. The foundational material, presented in the unstarred sections of Chapters 1 through 11, was normally covered, but different applications of this basic
material were stressed from year to year, and the book therefore contains more
material than was covered in anyone year. It can accordingly be used (with
omissions) as a text for a year's course in advanced calculus, or as a text for a
three-semester introduction to analysis.
These prerequisites are a good grounding in the calculus of one variable
from a mathematically rigorous point of view, together with some acquaintance
with linear algebra. The reader should be familiar with limit and continuity type
arguments and have a certain amount of mathematical sophistication. AB possible introductory texts, we mention Differential and Integral Calculus by R. Courant, Calculus by T. Apostol, Calculus by M. Spivak, and Pure Mathematics by
G. Hardy. The reader should also have some experience with partial derivatives.
In overall plan the book divides roughly into a first half which develops the
calculus (principally the differential calculus) in the setting of normed vector
spaces, and a second half which deals with the calculus of differentiable manifolds.
Vector space calculus is treated in two chapters, the differential calculus in
Chapter 3, and the basic theory of ordinary differential equations in Chapter 6.
The other early chapters are auxiliary. The first two chapters develop the necessary purely algebraic theory of vector spaces, Chapter 4 presents the material
on compactness and completeness needed for the more substantive results of
the calculus, and Chapter 5 contains a brief account of the extra structure encountered in scalar product spaces. Chapter 7 is devoted to multilinear (tensor)
algebra and is, in the main, a reference chapter for later use. Chapter 8 deals
with the theory of (Riemann) integration on Euclidean spaces and includes (in
exercise form) the fundamental facts about the Fourier transform. Chapters 9
and 10 develop the differential and integral calculus on manifolds, while Chapter
11 treats the exterior calculus of E. Cartan.
The first eleven chapters form a logical unit, each chapter depending on the
results of the preceding chapters. (Of course, many chapters contain material
that can be omitted on first reading; this is generally found in starred sections.)

On the other hand, Chapters 12, 13, and the latter parts of Chapters 6 and 11
are independent of each other, and are to be regarded as illustrative applications
of the methods developed in the earlier chapters. Presented here are elementary
Sturm-Liouville theory and Fourier series, elementary differential geometry,
potential theory, and classical mechanics. We usually covered only one or two
of these topics in our one-year course.
We have not hesitated to present the same material more than once from
different points of view. For example, although we have selected the contraction
mapping fixed-point theorem as our basic approach to the in1plicit-function
theorem, we have also outlined a "Newton's method" proof in the text and have
sketched still a third proof in the exercises. Similarly, the calculus of variations
is encountered twice-once in the context of the differential calculus of an
infinite-dimensional vector space and later in the context of classical mechanics.
The notion of a submanifold of a vector space is introduced in the early ohapters,
while the invariant definition of a manifold is given later on.
In the introductory treatment of vector space theory, we are more careful
and precise than is customary. In fact, this level of precision of language is not
maintained in the later chapters. Our feeling is that in linear algebra, where the
concepts are so clear and the axioms so familiar, it is pedagogically sound to
illustrate various subtle points, such as distinguishing between spaces that are
normally identified, discussing the naturality of various maps, and so on. Later
on, when overly precise language would be more cumbersome, the reader should
be able to produce for hin1self a more precise version of any assertions that he
finds to be formulated too loosely. Similarly, the proofs in the first few chapters
are presented in more formal detail. Again, the philosophy is that once the
student has mastered the notion of what constitutes a fonnal mathematical
proof, it is safe and more convenient to present arguments in the usual mathematical colloquialisms.
While the level of formality decreases, the level of mathematical sophistication does not. Thus increasingly abstract and sophisticated mathematical
objects are introduced. It has been our experience that Chapter 9 contains the
concepts most difficult for students to absorb, especially the notions of the
tangent space to a manifold and the Lie derivative of various objects with
respect to a vector field.

There are exercises of many different kinds spread throughout the book.
Some are in the nature of routine applications. Others ask the r~ader to fill in
or extend various proofs of results presented in the text. Sometimes whole
topics, such as the Fourier transform or the residue calculus, are presented in
exercise form. Due to the rather abstract nature of the textual material, the student is strongly advised to work out as many of the exercises as he possibly can.
Any enterprise of this nature owes much to many people besides the authors,
but we particularly wish to acknowledge the help of L. Ahlfors, A. Gleason,
R. Kulkarni, R. Rasala, and G. Mackey and the general influence of the book by
Dieudonne. We also wish to thank the staff of Jones and Bartlett for their invaluable
help in preparing this revised edition.

INTRODUCTION

This preliminary chapter contains a short exposition of the set theory that
forms the substratum of mathematical thinking today. It begins with a brief
discussion of logic, so that set theory can be discussed with some precision, and
continues with a review of the way in which mathematical objects can be defined
as sets. The chapter ends with four sections which treat specific set-theoretic
topics.
It is intended that this material be used mainly for reference. Some of it
will be familiar to the reader and some of it will probably be new. We suggest
that he read the chapter through "lightly" at first, and then refer back to it
for details as needed.
1. LOGIC: QUANTIFIERS

A statement is a sentence which is true or false as it stands. Thus '1 < 2' and
'4 3 = 5' are, respectively, true and false mathematical statements. Many
sentences occurring in mathematics contain variables and are therefore not true
or false as they stand, but become statements when the variables are given
values. Simple examples are 'x < 4', 'x < 1/', 'x is an integer', '3x 2
y2 = 10'.
Such sentences will be called statementjrames. If P(x) is a frame containing the
one variable 'x', then P(5) is the statement obtained by replacing 'x' in P(x) by
the numeral '5'. For example, if P(x) is 'x < 4', then P(5) is '5 < 4', P(0)
is '0 < 4', and so on.
Another way to obtain a statement from the frame P(x) is to assert that P(x)
is always true. We do this by prefixing the phrase 'for every x'. Thus, 'for every
x, x < 4' is a false statement, and 'for every x, x 2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x
1)' is a
true statement. This prefixing phrase is called a universal quantifier. Synonymous phrases are 'for each x' and 'for all x', and the symbol customarily
used is '("Ix)', which can be read in any of these ways. One frequently presents
sentences containing variables as being always true without explicitly writing
the universal quantifiers. For instance, the associative law for the addition of
numbers is often written

+

+

+

x

+ (y + z) =

(x

+ y) + z,

where it is understood that the equation is true for all x, y and z.
1

Thus the

2

INTRODUCTION

actual statement being made is
(Vx) (Vy) (Vz) [x

+ (y + z)

=

(x

+ y) + z].

Finally, we can convert the frame P(x) into a statement by asserting that
it is sometimes true, which we do by writing 'there exists an x such that P(x)'.
This process is called existential quantification. Synonymous prefixing phrases
here are 'there is an x such that', 'for some x', and, symbolically, '(::jx)'.
The statement '(Vx)(x < 4)' still contains the variable 'x', of course, but
'x' is no longer free to be given values, and is now called a bound variable.
Roughly speaking, quantified variables are bound and unquantified variables
are free. The notation 'P(x), is used only when 'x' is free in the sentence being
discussed.
Now suppose that we have a sentence P(x, y) containing two free variables.
Clearly, we need two quantifiers to obtain a statement from this sentence.
This brings us to a very important observation. If quantifiers of both types are
used, then the order in which they are written affects the meaning of the statement;
(::jy)(Vx)P(x, y) and (Vx)(::jy)P(x, y) say different things. The first says that one y
can be found that works for all x: "there exists a y such that for all x ... ".
The second says that for each x a y can be found that works: "for each x there
exists a y such that ... ". ~ut in the second case, it may very well happen that
when x is changed, the y that can be found will also have to be changed. The
existence of a single y that serves for all x is thus the stronger statement. For
example, it is true that (Vx)(::jy)(x < y) and false that (::jy)(Vx)(x < y). The
reader must be absolutely clear on this point; his whole mathematical future is
at stake. The second statement says that there exists a y, call it Yo, such that
(Vx)(x < Yo), that is, such that every number is less than Yo. This is false;
Yo
1, in particular, is not less than Yo. The first statement says that for each x
we can find a corresponding y. And we can: take y = x
1.
On the other hand, among a group of quantifiers of the same type the order
does not affect the meaning. Thus '(Vx) (Vy)' and '(Vy) (Vx) , have the same meaning. We often abbreviate such clumps of similar quantifiers by using the quantification symbol only once, as in '(Vx, y)', which can be read 'for every x and y'.
Thus the strictly correct '(Vx) (Vy) (Vz) [x + (y + z) = (x + y) + zl' receives the
slightly more idiomatic rendition '(Vx, y, z)[x + (y + z) = (x + y) + zl'. The
situation is clearly the same for a group of existential quantifiers.
The beginning student generally feels that the prefixing phrases 'for every x
there exists a y such that' and 'there exists a y such that for every x' sound
artificial and are unidiomatic. This is indeed the case, but this awkwardness is the
price that has to be paid for the order of the quantifiers to be fixed, so that the
meaning of the quantified statement is clear and unambiguous. Quantifiers do
occur in ordinary idiomatic discourse, but their idiomatic occurrences often
house ambiguity. The following two sentences are good examples of such
ambiguous idiomatic usage: "Every x is less than some y" and "Some y is greater
than every x". If a poll were taken, it would be found that most men on the

+

0.2

THE LOGICAL CONNECTIVES

street feel that these two sentences say the same thing, but half will feel that the
common assertion is false and half will think it true! The trouble here is that
the matrix is preceded by one quantifier and followed by another, and the poor
reader doesn't know which to take as the inside, or first applied, quantifier. The
two possible symbolic renditions of our first sentence, '[(Vx)(x < y)](3y)' and
'(Vx)[(x < y)(3y)1', are respectively false and true. Mathematicians do use
hanging quantifiers in the interests of more idiomatic writing, but only if they
are sure the reader will understand their order of application, either from the
context or by comparison with standard usage. In general, a hanging quantifier
would probably be read as the inside, or first applied, quantifier, and with this
understanding our two ambiguous sentences become true and false in that order.
After this apology the reader should be able to tolerate t.he definit.ion of
sequential convergence. It involves three quantifiers and runs as follows: The
sequence {xn} converges to x if (Ve) (3N) (Vn) (if n > N then IXn - xl < e).
In exactly the same format, we define a function f to be continuous at a if
(Ve) (3 0) (Vx) (if Ix - al < 0 then If(x) - f(a) I < e). We often omit an inside
universal quantifier by displaying the final frame, so that the universal quantification is understood. Thus we define f to be continuous at a if for every e
there is a 0 such that
if

Ix - al

< 0,

then

If(x) - f(a) I

<

E.

We shall study these definitions later. We remark only that it is perfectly
possible to build up an intuitive understanding of what these and similar
quantified statements actually say.
2. TIlE LOGICAL CONNECTIVES

When the word 'and' is inserted between two sentences, the resulting sentence
is true if both constituent sentences are true and is false otherwise. That is, the
"truth value", T or F, of the compound sentence depends only on the truth
values of the constituent sentences. We can thus describe the way 'and' acts in
compounding sentences in the simple "truth table"
P

Q

P and Q

T
T
F
F

T

T
F

where 'P' and 'Q' stand for arbitrary statement frames. Words like 'and' are
called logical connectives. It is often convenient to use symbols for connectives,
and a standard symbol for 'and' is the ampersand '&'. Thus 'P & Q' is read
'P andQ'.

4

0.2

INTRODUCTION

Another logical connective is the word 'or'. Unfortunately, this word is used
ambiguously in ordinary discourse. Sometimes it is used in the exclusive sense,
where 'P or Q' means that one of P and Q is true, but not both, and sometimes
it is used in the inclusive sense that at least one is true, and possibly both are
true. Mathematics cannot tolerate any fundamental ambiguity, and in mathematics 'or' is always used in the latter way. We thus have the truth table
P

Q

P orQ

T
T
F
F

T

The above two connectives are binary, in the sense that they combine two
sentences to form one new sentence. The word 'not' applies to one sentence and
really shouldn't be considered a connective at all; nevertheless, it is called a
unary connective. A standard symbol for 'not' is '~'. Its truth table is obviously
P

~P

T

F

F

T

In idiomatic usage the word 'not' is generally buried in the interior of a
sentence. We write' x is not equal to y' rather than' not (x is equal to y)'.
However, for the purpose of logical manipulation, the negation sign (the word
'not' or a symbol like '~') precedes the sentence being negated. We shall, of
course, continue to write 'x ~ y', but keep in mind that this is idiomatic for
'not (x = y)' or '~(x = y)'.
We come now to the troublesome 'if ... ,then ... ' connective, which we
write as either 'if P, then Q' or 'P ==} Q'. This is almost always applied in the
universally quantified context (Vx) (P(x) ==} Q(x»), and its meaning is best
unraveled by a study of this usage. We consider 'if x < 3, then x < 5' to be a
true sentence. More exactly, it is true for all x, so that the universal quantification (Vx)(x < 3 ==} x < 5) is a true statement. This conclusion forces us to
agree that, in particular, '2 < 3 ==} 2 < 5', '4 < 3 ==} 4 < 5', and '6 < 3 ==}
6 < 5' are all true statements. The truth table for '==}' thus contains the
values entered below.

On the other hand, we consider 'x < 7 ==} x < 5' to be a false sentence, and
therefore have to agree that '6 < 7 ==} 6 < 5' is false. Thus the remaining row
in the table above gives the value 'F' for P ==} Q.
Combinations of frame variables and logical connectives such as we have
been considering are called truth-functional forms. We can further combine the
elementary forms such as 'P ==} Q' and '",P' by connectives to construct composite forms such as '",(P ==} Q)' and '(P ==} Q) & (Q ==} P)'. A sentence has a
given (truth-functional) form if it can be obtained from that form by substitution.
Thus 'x < y or ",(x < V)' has the form 'P or ",P', since it is obtained from this
form by substituting the sentence 'x < y' for the sentence variable 'P'. Composite truth-functional forms have truth tables that can be worked out by
combining the elementary tables. For example, '",(P ==} Q)' has the table below,
the truth value for the whole form being in the column under the connective
which is applied last ('",' in this example).

Q

",(P

Thus", (P ==} Q) is true only when P is true and Q is false.
A truth-functional form such as 'P or (",P), which is always true (i.e., has
only 'T' in the final column of its truth table) is called a tautology or a tautologous
form. The reader can check that
((P

and

==}

Q) & (Q

==}

R))

==}

(P

==}

R)

are also tautologous. Indeed, any valid principle of reasoning that does not
involve quantifiers must be expressed by a tautologous form.
The 'if and only if' form 'P <=? Q', or 'P if and only if Q', or 'P iff Q', is an
abbreviation for '(P ==} Q) & (Q ==} P)'. Its truth table works out to be
P

Q

P<=?Q

T
T
F

That is, P <=? Q is true if P and Q have the same truth values, and is false
otherwise.
Two truth-functional forms A and B are said to be equivalent if (the final
columns of) their truth tables are the same, and, in view of the table for '<=?',
we see that A and B are equivalent if A <=? B is tautologous, and conversely.

INTRODUCTION

Replacing a sentence obtained by substitution in a form A by the equivalent
sentence obtained by the same substitutions in an equivalent form B is a device
much used in logical reasoning. Thus to prove a statement P true, it suffices to
prove the statement ",P false, since 'P' and '",(",P), are equivalent forms.
Other important equivalences are
",(P or Q)

~

(",P) & (",Q),

(P => Q)
",(P => Q)

~

Q or (",P),
P & (",Q).

~

A bit of conventional sloppiness which we shall indulge in for smoother
idiom is the use of 'if' instead of the correct 'if and only if' in definitions. We
definefto be continuous at x if so-and-so, meaning, of course, thatfis continuous
at x if and only if so-and-so. This causes no difficulty, since it is clear that 'if
and only if' is meant when a definition is being given.
3. NEGATIONS OF QUANTIFIERS

The combinations '",(V'x)' and '(3x)",' have the same meanings: something is
not always true if and only if it is sometimes false. Similarly, '",(3y)' and '(V'y)",'
have the same meanings. These equivalences can be applied to move a negation
sign past each quantifier in a string of quantifiers, giving the following important
practical rule:
In taking the negation of a statement beginning with a string of quantifiers,
we simply change each quantifier to the opposite kind and move the negation
sign to the end of the string.

Thus
",(V'x)(3y) (V'z)P(x, y, z)

~

(3x)(V'y)(3z)",P(x, y, z).

There are other principles of quantificational reasoning that can be isolated
and which we shall occasionally mention, but none seem worth formalizing here.
4. SETS

It is present-day practice to define every mathematical object as a set of some
kind or other, and we must examine this fundamental notion, however briefly.
A set is a collection of objects that is itself considered an entity. The objects
in the collection are called the elements or members of the set. The symbol for
'is a member of' is 'E' (a sort of capital epsilon), so that 'x E A' is read "x is a
member of A", "x is an element of A", "x belongs to A", or "x is in A".
We use the equals sign '=' in mathematics to mean logical identity; A = B
means that A is B. Now a set A is considered to be the same object as a set B
if and only if A and B have exactly the same members. That is, 'A = B' means
that (V'x)(x E A ~ x E B).

0.4

SETS

7

We say that a set A is a subset of a set B, or that A is included in B (or that
B is a superset of A) if every element of A is an element of B. The symbol for
inclusion is Ie'. Thus 'A e B' means that (Yx)(x E A = } x E B). Clearly,
(A = B)

{=}

(A

e B)

and (B

e

A).

This is a frequently used way of establishing set identity: we prove that A = B
by proving that A e B and that B e A. If the reader thinks about the above
equivalence, he will see that it depends first on the equivalence of the truth-functional forms 'P {=} Q' and '(P =} Q) & (Q =} P)', and then on the obvious
quantificational equivalence between '(Yx)(R & S)' and '(Yx)R & (Yx)S'.
We define a set by specifying its members. If the set is finite, the members
can actually be listed, and the notation used is braces surrounding a membership list. For example {I, 4, 7} is the set containing the three numbers 1, 4, 7,
{x} is the unit set of x (the set having only the one object x as a member),
and {x, y} is the pair set of x and y. We can abuse this notation to name some
infinite sets. Thus {2, 4, 6, 8, ... } would certainly be considered the set of all
even positive integers. But infinite sets are generally defined by statement
frames. If P(x) is a frame containing the free variable 'x', then {x : P(x)} is the
set of all x such that P(x) is true. In other words, {x : P(x)} is that set A such
that
yEA

{=}

P(y).

For example, {x: x 2 < 9} is the set of all real numbers x such that x 2 < 9,
that is, the open interval (-3, 3), and y E {x : x 2 < 9} {=} y2 < 9. A statement
frame P(x) can be thought of as stating a property that an object x mayor may
not have, and {x : P(x)} is the set of all objects having that property.
We need the empty set 0, in much the same way that we need zero in
arithmetic. If P(x) is never true, then {x: P(x)} = 0. For example,
{x:x ~ x}

= 0.

When we said earlier that all mathematical objects are customarily considered sets, it was taken for granted that the reader understands the distinction
between an object and a name of that object. To be on the safe side, we add a
few words. A chair is not the same thing as the word 'chair', and the number 4
is a mathematical object that is not the same thing as the numeral '4'. The
numeral '4' is a name of the number 4, as also are 'four', '2 2', and 'IV'.
According to our present viewpoint, 4 itself is taken to be some specific set.
There is no need in this course to carry logical analysis this far, but some readers
may be interested to know that we usually define 4 as {O, 1, 2, 3}. Similarly,
2 = {O, I}, 1 = {O}, and 0 is the empty set 0.
It should be clear from the above discussion and our exposition thus far
that we are using a symbol surrounded by single quotation marks as a name of
that symbol (the symbol itself being a name of something else). Thus' '4' , is a
name of '4' (which is itself a name of the number 4). This is strictly correct

+

8

INTRODUCTION

usage, but mathematicians almost universally mishandle it. It is accurate to
write: let x be the number; call this number 'x'. However, the latter is almost
always written: call this number x. This imprecision causes no difficulty to the
reading mathematician, and it often saves the printed page from a shower of
quotation marks. There is, however, a potential victim of such ambiguous
treatment of symbols. This is the person who has never realized that mathematics is not about symbols but about objects to which the symbols refer. Since
by now the present reader has safely avoided this pitfall, we can relax and
occasionally omit the strictly necessary quotation marks.
In order to avoid overworking the word 'set', we use many synonyms,
such as 'class', 'collection', 'family' and 'aggregate'. Thus we might say, "Let a
be a family of classes of sets". If a shoe store is a collection of pairs of shoes, then
a chain of shoe stores is such a three-level object.
5. RESTRICTED VARIABLES

A variable used in mathematics is not allowed to take all objects as values; it
can only take as values the members of a certain set, called the domain of the
variable. The dOInain is sometimes explicitly indicated, but is often only implied. For example, the letter' n' is customarily used to specify an integer, so
that' (Vn)P(n) , would automatically be read "for every integer n, P(n)". However, sometimes n is taken to be a positive integer. In case of possible ambiguity
or doubt, we would indicate the restriction explicitly and write' ("In E 71.)P(n)',
where' 71.' is the standard symbol for the set of all integers. The quantifier is
read, literally, "for all n in 71.", and more freely, "for every integer n". Similarly,
'(3n E 71.)P(n), is read "there exists an n in 71. such that P(n)" or "there exists
an integer n such that P(n)". Note that the symbol 'E' is here read as the
preposition' in'. The above quantifiers are called restricted quantifiers.
In the same way, we have restricted set formation, both implicit and explicit,
as in '{n: P(n)} , and '{n E 71. : pen)}', both of which are read "the set of all
integers n such that P(n)".
Restricted variables can be defined as abbreviations of unrestricted variables
by
("Ix E A)P(x)

¢=>

(3x E A)P(x)

¢=>

{x E A :P(x)}

=

("Ix) (x E A => P(x)),
(3x) (x E A & P(x)),
{x:x E A & P(x)}.

Although there is never any ambiguity in sentences containing explicitly
restricted variables, it sometimes helps the eye to see the structure of the
sentence if the restricting phrases are written in superscript position, as in
(Ve>o)(3n EZ ). Some restriction was implicit on page 1. If the reader agreed that
(Vx)(x 2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x
1)) was true, he probably took x to be a real
number.

ORDERED PAIRS AND RELATIONS

9

6. ORDERED PAIRS AND RELATIONS

Ordered pairs are basic tools, as the reader knows from analytic geometry.
According to our general principle, the ordered pair -< a, b> is taken to be a
certain set, but here again we don't care which particular set it is so long as it
guarantees the crucial characterizing property:
-<x,y> = -<a,b>

R

x = aandy = b.

Thus -<1, 3> ~ -<3,1>.
The notion of a correspondence, or relation, and the special case of a mapping, or function, is fundamental to mathematics. A correspondence is a pairing
of objects such that given any two objects x and y, the pair -< x, y> either does
or does not correspond. A particular correspondence (relation) is generally
presented by a statement frame P(x, y) having two free variables, with x and y
corresponding if any only if P(x, y) is true. Given any relation (correspondence),
the set of all ordered pairs -<x, y> of corresponding elements is called its graph.
Now a relation is a mathematical object, and, as we have said several times,
it is current practice to regard every mathematical object as a set of some sort
or other. Since the graph of a relation is a set (of ordered pairs), it is efficient and
customary to take the graph to be the relation. Thus a relation (correspondence)
is simply a set of ordered pairs. If R is a relation, then we say that x has the
relation R to y, and we write 'xRy', if and only if -<x, y> E R. We also say
that x corresponds to y under R. The set of all first elements occurring in the
ordered pairs of a relation R is called the domain of R and is designated dom R
or ~(R). Thus
dom R = {x: (~y)-<x, y> E R}.
The set of second elements is called the mnge of R:
rangeR =

{y:(~x)-<x,y>

ER}.

The inverse, R-l, of a relation R is the set of ordered pairs obtained by reversing
those of R:
R- 1 = {-<x, y> : -<y, x> E R}.
A statement frame P(x, y) having two free variables actually determines a pair
of mutually inverse relations R & S, called the gmphs of P, as follows:
R

=

{-<x, y> : P(x, y)},

S = {-<y, x> : P(x, y)}.

A two-variable frame together with a choice of which variable is considered to
be first might be called a directed frame. Then a directed frame would have a
uniquely determined relation for its graph. The relation of strict inequality
on the real number system IR would be considered the set {-<x, y> : x < y},
since the variables in 'x < y' have a natural order.
The set A X B = {-<x, y> : x E A & y E B} of all ordered pairs with
first element in A and second element in B is called the Cartesian product of the

10

0.7

INTRODUCTION

sets A and B. A relation R is always a subset of dom R X range R. If the two
"factor spaces" are the same, we can use exponential notation: A 2 = A X A.
The Cartesian product R2 = R X R is the "analytic plane". Analytic
geometry rests upon the one-to-one coordinate correspondence between R2 and
the Euclidean plane [2 (determined by an axis system in the latter), which
enables us to treat geometric questions algebraically and algebraic questions
geometrically. In particular, since a relation between sets of real numbers is a
subset of R2, we can "picture" it by the corresponding subset of the Euclidean
plane, or of any model of the Euclidean plane, such as this page. A simple
Cartesian product is shown in Fig. 0.1 (A U B is the union of the sets A and B).

If R is a relation and A is any set, then the restriction of R to A, R
is the subset of R consisting of those pairs with first element in A:

R

tA

=

r A,

{-<x, y> : -<x, y> E R and x E A}.

Thus R r A = R n (A X range R), where C n D is the intersection of the sets
CandD.
If R is a relation and A is any set, then the image oj A under R, R[A), is
the set of second elements of ordered pairs in R whose first elements are in A:
R[A} = {y: (3x)(x E A & -<x. y> E R)}.

Thus R[A] = range (R

r A), as shown in Fig. 0.2.

7. FUNCTIONS AND MAPPINGS

A Junction is a relation J such that each domain element x is paired with exactly
one range element y. This property can be expressed as follows:
-<x, y> EJ and -<x,

Z> EJ

y = z.

FUNCTIONS AND MAPPINGS

The y which is thus uniquely determined by f and x is designated f(x):
y = f(x)

~

<x, y> Ef.

One tends to think of a function as being active and a relation which is not
a function as being passive. A function f acts on an element x in its domain to
givef(x). We take x and apply fto it; indeed we often call a function an operator.
On the other hand, if R is a relation but not a function, then there is in general
no particular y related to an element x in its domain, and the pairing of x and y
is viewed more passively.
We often define a function f by specifying its value f(x) for each x in its
domain, and in this connection a stopped arrow notation is used to indicate the
pairing. Thus x 1-+ x 2 is the function assigning to each number x its square x 2•

Fig. 0.3

If we want it to be understood that f is this function, we can write "Consider
the function f: x 1-+ X2ll • The domain of f must be understood for this notation
to be meaningful.
If f is a function, then 1 is of course a relation, but in general it is not a
function. For example, if f is the function x 1-+ X2, then 1 contains the pairs
<4,2> and <4, -2> and so is not a function (see Fig. 0.3). If 1 is a function, we say that f is one-to-one and that f is a one-to-one correspondence between
its domain and its range. Each x E domf corresponds to only one y E rangef
(f is a function), and each y E range f corresponds to only one x E dom f (r1 is
a function).
The notation·
f:A -tB

r

is read "a (the) function f on A into B" or "the function f from A to B". The
notation implies that f is a function, that domf = A, and that range feB.
Many people feel that the very notion of function should include all these
ingredients; that is, a function should be considered an ordered triple <f, A, B> ,
where f is a function according to our more limited definition, A is the domain

of f, and B is a superset of the range of f, which we shall call the codomain of f in
this context. We shall use the terms 'map', 'mapping', and 'transformation'
for such a triple, so that the notationf: A --+ B in its totality presents a mapping.
Moreover, when there is no question about which set is the codomain, we shall
often call the function f itself a mapping, since the triple -<f, A, B>- is then
determined by f. The two arrow notations can be combined, as in: "Define
f: !Fl --+ !Fl by x 1-+ x 2 ".
A mapping f: A --+ B is said to be injective if f is one-to-one, surjective if
range f = B, and bijective if it is both injective and surjective. A bijective
mapping f: A --+ B is thus a one-to-one correspondence between its domain A
and its codomain B. Of course, a function is always surjective onto its range R,
and the statement that f is surjective means that R = B, where B is the understood codomain.
8. PRODUCT SETS; INDEX NOTATION

One of the characteristic habits of the modern mathematician is that as soon as
a new kind of object has been defined and discussed a little, he immediately
looks at the set of all such objects. With the notion of a function from A to S
well in hand, we naturally consider the set of all functions from A to S, which we
designate SA. Thus!Fl R is the set of all real-valued functions of one real variable,
and sz+ is the set of all infinite sequences in S. (It is understood that an infinite
sequence is nothing but a function whose domain is the set Z+ of all positive
integers.) Similarly, if we set n = {I, ... , n}, then Sri is the set of all finite
sequences of length n in S.
If B is a subset of S, then itR characteristic function (relative to S) is the function on S, usually designated XB, which has the constant value I on B and the
constant value 0 off B. The set of all characteristic functions of subsets of S is
thus 28 (since 2 = {O, I} ). But because this collection of functions is in a
natural one-to-one correspondence with the collection of all subsets of S, XB
corresponding to B, we tend to identify the two collections. Thus 28 is also
interpreted as the set of all subsets of S. We shall spend most of the remainder
of this section discussing further similar definitional ambiguities which mathematicians tolerate.
The ordered triple -< x, y, z>- is usually defined to be the ordered pair
-< -< x, y>- , z>- . The reason for this definition is probably that a function of
two variables x and y is ordinarily considered a function of the single ordered
pair variable -<x, y>-, so that, for example, a real-valued function of two real
variables is a subset of (!Fl X !Fl) X !Fl. But we also consider such a function a
subset of Cartesian 3-space !Fl 3 • Therefore, we define !Fl 3 as (!Fl X !Fl) X !Fl;
that is, we define the ordered triple -<x, y, z>- as -< -<x, y>-. z>-.
On the other hand, the ordered triple -<x, y, z>- could also be regarded as
the finite sequence { -< I, x>-, -< 2, y>-, -< 3, z>- }, which, of course, is a different
object. These two models for an ordered triple serve equally well, and, again,

0.8

mathematicians tend to slur over the distinction. We shall have more to say
on this point later when we discuss natural isomorphisms (Section 1.6). For
the moment we shall simply regard IRa and 1R"3" as being the same; an ordered
triple is something which can be "viewed" as being either an ordered pair of
which the first element is an ordered pair or as a sequence of length 3 (or, for that
matter, as an ordered pair of which the second element is an ordered pair).
Similarly, we pretend that Cartesian 4-space 1R4 is 1R4 , 1R2 X 1R2, or
IRI X IRa = IR X ((IR X IR) X IR), etc. Clearly, we are in effect assuming an
associative law for ordered pair formation that we don't really have.
This kind of ambiguity, where we tend to identify two objects that really are
distinct, is a necessary corollary of deciding exactly what things are. It is one
of the prices we pay for the precision of set theory; in days when mathematics
was vaguer, there would have been a single fuzzy notion.
The device of indices, which is used frequently in mathematics, also has ambiguous implications which we should examine. An indexed collection, as a set,
is nothing but the range set of a function, the indexing function, and a particular
indexed object, say Xi, is simply the value of that function at the domain element i.
If the set of indices is I, the indexed set is designated {Xi: i E l} or {Xi};EI
(or {Xi};:'l in case I = Z+). However, this notation suggests that we view the
indexed set as being obtained by letting the index run through the index set I
and collecting the indexed objects. That is, an indexed set is viewed as being
the set together with the indexing function. This ambivalence is reflected in the
fact that the same notation frequently designates the mapping. Thus we refer
to the sequence {Xn}:=l, where, of course, the sequence is the mapping n ~ Xn.
We believe that if the reader examines his idea of a sequence he will find this
ambiguity present. He means neither just the set nor just the mapping, but the
mapping with emphasis on its range, or the range "together with" the mapping.
But since set theory cannot reflect these nuances in any simple and graceful way,
we shall take an indexed set to be the indexing function. Of course, the same
range object may be repeated with different indices; there is no implication that
an indexing is one-to-one. Note also that indexing imposes no restriction on the
set being indexed; any set can at least be self-indexed (by the identity function).
Except for the ambiguous' {Xi: i E I}', there is no universally used notation
for the indexing function. Since Xi is the value of the function at i, we might
think of 'x;' as another way of writing 'xCi)', in which case we designate the
function 'x' or 'x'. We certainly do this in the case of ordered n-tuplets when
we say, "Consider the n-tuplet x = -< XI, • . • , x n »". On the other hand, there
is no compelling reason to use this notation. We can call the indexing function
anything we want; if it is j, then of course j( i) = Xi for all i.
We come now to the general definition of Cartesian product. Earlier we
argued (in a special case) that the Cartesian product A X B X C is the set of
all ordered triples x = -<XI, X2, xa» such that Xl E A, X2 E B, and Xa E C.
More generally, A I X A 2 X ... X An, or IIi=1 Ai, is the set of ordered ntuples x = -< XI, . . . , xn» such that Xi E Ai for i = 1, ... ,n. If we interpret

Theorem. A mapping f: A ---t B has an inverse if and only if it is bijective,
in which case its inverse is its relational inverse f-l.
Proof. If fis bijective, then the relational inverser 1 is a function from B to A,
and the equations fori = I Band r 1 0 f = I A are obvious. On the other
hand, if fog = I B, then f is surjective, since then every y in B can be written
y = f(g(y»). And if g 0 f = I A, then f is injective, for then the equation
f(x) = f(y) implies that x = y(j(x») = y(j(y») = y. Thus f is bijective if it

has an inverse. D
Now let ~(A) be the set of all bijections f: A ---t A. Then ~(A) is closed
under the binary operation of composition and
1) f 0 (y 0 h) = (f 0 y) 0 h for all f, g, h E~;
2) there exists a unique I E ~(A) such that f 0 I = I 0 f = f for all f E ~;
3) for each f E ~ there exists a unique y E ~ such that fog = g 0 f = I.
Any set G closed under a binary operation having these properties is called
a group with respect to that operation. Thus ~(A) is a group with respect to
composition.
Composition can also be defined for relations as follows. If RCA X Band
S C B X C, then S 0 RCA X C is defined by
-<x,z>- ESoR <=> ( 3y EB)(-<x,y>- ER& -<y,z>- ES).

If Rand S are mappings, this definition agrees with our earlier one.
10. DUALITY

There is another elementary but important phenomenon called duality which
occurs in practically all branches of mathematics. Let F: A X B ---t C be any
function of two variables. It is obvious that if x is held fixed, then F(x, y) is a
function of the one variable y. That is, for each fixed x there is a function
h X: B ---t C defined by hX(y) = F(x, y). Then x 1-+ hX is a mapping cp of A into
CB. Similarly, each y E B yields a function gy E C A , where gy(x) = F(x, y),
and y 1-+ yy is a mapping (J from B to CA.
Now suppose conversely that we are given a mapping cp: A ---t CB. For each
x E A we designate the corresponding value of cp in index notation as h so
that hX is a function from B to C, and we define F: A X B ---t C by F(x, y) =
hX(y). We are now back where we started. Thus the mappings cp: A ---t C B,
/1': A X B ---t C, and (J: B ---t CA are equivalent, and can be thought of as three
different ways of viewing the same phenomenon. The extreme mappings cp and
(J will be said to be dual to each other.
X,

INTRODUCTION

The mapping I() is the indexed family of functions {hx: x E A} C CB. Now
suppose that 5' C CB is an unindexed collection of functions on B into C, and
define F: 5' X B -+ C by F(f, y) = f(y). Then 8: B -+ (J'.f is defined by gll(f) =
f(y). What is happening here is simply that in the expressionf(y) we regard both
symbols as variables, so that f(y) is a function on 5' X B. Then when we hold y
fixed, we have a function on 5' mapping 5' into C.
W c shall see some important applications of this duality principle as our
subject develops. For example, an m X n matrix is a function t = {tij} in
RmXn. We picture the matrix as a rectangular array of numbers, where Ii' is
the row index and Ij' is the column index, so that tij is the number at the intersection of the ith row and the jth column. If we hold i fixed, we get the n-tuple
forming the ith row, and the matrix can therefore be interpreted as an m-tuple
of row n-tuples. Similarly (dually), it can be viewed as an n-tuple of column
m-tuples.
In the same vein, an n-tuple -<!I, ... ,fn > of functions from A to B can
be regarded as a single n-tuple-valued function from A to Bn,

In a somewhat different application, duality will allow us to regard a finitedimensional vector space V as being its own second conjugate space (V*)*.
It is instructive to look at elementary Euclidean geometry from this point
of view. Today we regard a straight line as being a set of geometric points.
An older and more neutral view is to take points and lines as being two different
kinds of primitive objects. Accordingly, let A be the set of all points (so that A
is the Euclidean plane as we now view it), and let B be the set of all straight lines.
Let F be the incidence function: F(p, l) = 1 if p and I are incident (p is "on" l,
I is "on" p) and F(p, l) = 0 otherwise. Thus F maps A X B into {O, 1}. Then
for each IE B the function gl(P) = F(p, I) is the characteristic function of the
set of points that we think of as being the line l (gl(P) has the value 1 if p is on l
and 0 if p is not on l.) Thus each line determines the set of points that are on it.
But, dually, each point p determines the set of lines I "on" it, through its characteristic function hP(I). Thus, in complete duality we can regard a line as being
a set of points and a point as being a set of lines. This duality aspect of geometry
is basic in projective geometry.
It is sometimes awkward to invent new notation for the "partial" function
obtained by holding a variable fixed in a function of several variables, as we did
above when we set gil (x) = F(x, y), and there is another device that is frequently
useful in this situation. This is to put a dot in the position of the "varying
variable". Thus F(a,') is the function of one variable obtained from F(x, y)
by holding x fixed at the value a, so that in our beginning discussion of duality
we have
hX = F(x, .),
gil = F(·, y).
If f is a function of one variable, we can then write f

=

f('), and so express the

0.11

THE BOOLEAN OPERATIONS

17

above equations also as h"'(-) = F(x, .), gy(-) = F( . , y). The flaw in this notation
is that we can't indicate substitution without losing meaning. Thus the value
of the function F(x,·) at b is F(x, b), but from this evaluation we cannot read
backward and tell what function was evaluated. Weare therefore forced to
some such cumbersome notation as F(x, ·)/b, which can get out of hand. Nevertheless, the dot device is often helpful when it can be used without evaluation
difficulties. In addition to eliminating the need for temporary notation, as
mentioned above, it can also be used, in situations where it is strictly speaking
superfluous, to direct the eye at once to the position of the variable.
For example, later on D~F will designate the directional derivative of the
function F in the (fixed) direction~. This is a function whose value at a is
D~F(a), and the notation D~F(-) makes this implicitly understood fact explicit.
11. THE BOOLEAN OPERATIONS

Let S be a fixed domain, and let 5' be a family of subsets of S. The union of 5',
or the union of all the sets in 5', is the set of all elements belonging to at least one
set in 5'. We designate the union U5' or UAE~ A, and thus we have
U5' = {x: (3A E~)(X E A)},

Y E U5'

¢=}

(3A E~)(y E A).

We often consider the family 5' to be indexed. That is, we assume given a set I
(the set of indices) and a surjective mapping i 1-+ Ai from I to 5', so that 5' =
{Ai: i E I}. Then the union of the indexed collection is designated UiEI Ai or
U {Ai: i E I}. The device of indices has both technical and psychological
advantages, and we shall generally use it.
If 5' is finite, and either it or the index set is listed, then a different notation
is used for its union. If 5' = {A, B}, we designate the union A U B, a notation
that displays the listed names. Note that here we have x E A u B ¢=} x E A or
x E B. If 5' = {Ai: i = 1, ... ,n}, we generally write 'AI U A2 U· .. U An'
or 'Uf=l Ai' for U5'·
The intersection of the indexed family {Ai}iEI, designated niEI Ai, is the
set of all points that lie in every Ai. Thus
x E nAi

¢=}

iEI

fYiEI)(x E Ai).

For an unindexed family 5' we use the notation n5' or nAE~ A, and if 5' =
{A, B}, then n5' = An B.
The complement, A', of a subset of S is the set of elements x ,~: S not in
A: A' = {XES: x fJ. A}. The law of De Morgan states that the complement of
an intersection is the union of the complements:

Even here, thinking in terms of indices makes the laws more intuitive. Thus

The family 5' is disjoint if distinct sets in 5' have no elements in common, i.e.,
if ('IX, yE5')(X ~ Y =} X n Y = 0). For an indexed family {Ai}iEI the
condition becomes i ~ J =} Ai n Aj = 0. If 5' = {A, B}, we simply say that
A and B are disjoint.

PARTITIONS AND EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS

19

The first, but not the other two, of the three identities above remains valid
when f is replaced by any relation R. It follows from the commutative law,
(3x)(3y)A ~ (3y)(3x)A. The second identity fails for a general R because
'(3x)(Vy)' and '(Vy)(3x)' have different meanings.
12. PARTITIONS AND EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS

A partition of a set A is a disjoint family ;r of sets whose union is A. We call the
elements of;r 'fibers', and we say that;r fibers A or is afibering of A. For example,
the set of straight lines parallel to a given line in the Euclidean plane is a fibering
of the plane. If 'x' designates the unique fiber containing the point x, then
x ~ x is a surjective mapping 71': A ~ ;r which we call the projection of A on;r.
Passing from a set A to a fibering ;r of A is one of the principal ways of forming
new mathematical objects.
Any function f automatically fibers its domain into sets on which f is constant. If A is the Euclidean plane and f(p) is the x-coordinate of the point p in
some coordinate system, then f is constant on each vertical line; more exactly,
j-l(X) is a vertical line for every x in IR. Moreover, x ~ j-l(X) is a bijection
from IR to the set of all fibers (vertical lines). In general, if j: A ~ B is any surjective mapping, and if for each value y in B we set
Ay

=

j-l(y)

=

{x E A: j(x)

=

y},

then ;r = {Ay: y E B} is a fibering of A and cp: y ~ Ay is a bijection from
B to;r. Also cp 0 f is the projection 71': A ~;r, since cp 0 j(x) = cp(j(x) is the
set x of all z in A such that j(z) = j(x).
The above process of generating a fibering of A from a function on A is
relatively trivial. A more important way of obtaining a fibering of A is from
an equality-like relation on A called an equivalence relation. An equivalence
relation ~ on A is a binary relation which is reflexive (x ~ x for every x E A),
symmetric (x ~ y =? Y ~ x), and transitive (x ~ y and y ~ z =? X ~ z). Every
fibering;r of A generates a relation ~ by the stipulation that x ~ y if and only if
x and yare in the same fiber, and obviously ~ is an equivalence relation. The
most important fact to be established in this section is the converse.
Theorem. Every equivalence relation
of a fibering.

~

on A is the equivalence relation

Proof. We obviously have to define x as the set of elements y equivalent to x,
x = {y: y ~ x}, and our problem is to show that the family ;r of all subsets of A

obtained this way is a fibering.
The reflexive, symmetric, and transitive laws become
x Ex,

x E 'ii

=?

Y Ex,

and

x E 'ii and y E Z

=? X

E Z.

Reflexivity thus implies that ;r covers A. Transitivity says that if y E z, then
x E 'ii =? X E z; that is, if y E z, then 'ii c z. But also, if y E z, then z E 'ii by

symmetry, and so z C y. Thus y E z implies y = z. Therefore, if two of our
sets a and b have a point x in common, then a = x = 0. In other words, if a is
not the set b, then a and b are disjoint, and we have a fibering. 0
The fundamental role this argument plays in mathematics is due to the fact
that in many important situations equivalence relations occur as the primary
object, and then are used to define partitions and functions. We give two
examples.
Let lL be the integers (positive, negative, and zero). A fraction 'min' can
be considered an ordered pair -< m, n>- of integers with n -:;e o. The set of all
fractions is thus lL X (lL - {OJ). Two fractions -<m, n>- and -<p, q>- are
"equal" if and only if mq = np, and equality is checked to be an equivalence
relation. The equivalence class -< m, n>- is the object taken to be the rational
number min. Thus the rational number system Q is the set of fibers in a partition of lL X (lL - {O}).
Next, we choose a fixed integer p ElL and define a relation E on lL by
mEn <=> p divides m - n. Then E is an equivalence relation, and the set lLp of
its equivalence classes is called the integers modulo p. It is easy to see that mEn
if and only if m and n have the same remainder when divided by p, so that in
this case there is an easily calculated function f, where f(m) is the remainder
after dividing m by p, which defines the fibering. The set of possible remainders
is {O, 1, ... , p - I}, so that lLp contains p elements.
A function on a set A can be "factored" through a fibering of A by the
following theorem.
Theorem. Let g be a function on A, and let g: be a fibering of A. Then g
is constant on each fiber of g: if and only if there exists a function y on g:
such that g = y 0 7r.

Proof. If g is constant on each fiber of g:, then the association of this unique

VECTOR SPACES

The calculus of functions of more than one variable unites the calculus of one
variable, which the reader presumably knows, with the theory of vector spaces,
and the adequacy of its treatment depends directly on the extent to which vector
space theory really is used. The theories of differential equations and differential
geometry are similarly based on a mixture of calculus and vector space theory.
Such "vector calculus" and its applications constitute the subject matter of this
book, and in order for our treatment to be completely satisfactory, we shall
have to spend considerable time at the beginning studying vector spaces themselves. This we do principally in the first two chapters. The present chapter is
devoted to general vector spaces and the next chapter to finite-dimensional
spaces.
We begin this chapter by introducing the basic concepts of the subjectvector spaces, vector subspaces, linear combinations, and linear transformations-and then relate these notions to the lines and planes of geometry. Next
we establish the most elementary formal properties of linear transformations and
Cartesian product vector spaces, and take a brief look at quotient vector spaces.
This brings us to our first major objective, the study of direct sum decompositions, which we undertake in the fifth section. The chapter concludes with a
preliminary examination of bilinearity.
I. FUNDAMENTAL NOTIONS
Vector spaces and subspaces. The reader probably has already had some
eontact with the notion of a vector space. l\Iost beginning calculus texts discuss
1!:cometric vectors, which are represented by "arrows" drawn from a chosen
origin O. These vectors are added geometrically by the parallelogram rule:
The sum of the vector 01 (represented by the arrow from 0 to A) and the
vcctor Oii is the vector QP, where P is the vertex opposite 0 in the parallelogram
having OA and OB as two sides (Fig. 1.1). Vectors can also be multiplied by
numbers: x(o"A) is that vector DB such that B is on the line through 0 and
:1, the distance from 0 to B is Ixl times the distance from 0 to A, and B and A
arc on the same side of 0 if x is positive, and on opposite sides if x is negative

Fig. 1.3

(Fig. 1.2). These two vector operations satisfy certain laws of algebra,
which we shall soon state in the definition. The geometric proofs of these laws
are generally sketchy, consisting more of plausibility arguments than of airtight
logic. For example, the geometric figure in Fig. 1.3 is the essence of the usual
proof that vector addition is associative. In each case the final vector OX is
represented by the diagonal starting from 0 in the parallelepiped constructed
from the three edges OA, OB, and ~C. The set of all geometric vectors, together
with these two operations and the laws of algebra that they satisfy, constitutes
one example of a vector space. We shall return to this situation in Section 2.
The reader may also have seen coordinate triples tr€ated as vectors. In this
system a three-dimensional vector is an ordered triple of numbers -< Xl, X2, xa>
which we think of geometrically as the coordinates of a point in space. Addition
is now algebraically defined,
-<Xb X2,Xa>

+ -<YbY2,Ya>

= -<Xl+Yb X.2+Y2,Xa+Ya>,

as is multiplication by numbers, t-<Xl' X2, xa> = -<tXl, tX2, tXa>.
The
vector laws are much easier to prove for these objects, since they are almost
algebraic formalities. The set ~3 of all ordered triples of numbers, together with
these two operations, is a second example of a vector space.

1.1

If we think of an ordered triple -<Xli X2, X3 >- as a function x with domain
the set of integers from 1 to 3, where Xi is the value of the function x at i (see
Section 0.8), then this vector space suggests a general type called a function
space, which we shall examine after the definition. For the moment we remark
only that we defined the sum of the triple x and the triple y as that triple z
such that Zi = Xi
Yi for every i.
A vector space, then, is a collection of objects that can be added to each
other and multiplied by numbers, subject to certain laws of algebra. In this
context a number is often called a scalar.

Definition. Let V be a set, and let there be given a mapping -< a, fl >- .a
fl from V X V to V, called addition, and a mapping -<x, a>- .- xa
from IR X V to V, called multiplication by scalars. Then V is a vector space

In contexts where it is clear (as it generally is) which operations are intended,
we refer simply to the vector space V.
Certain further properties of a vector space follow directly from the axioms.
Thus the zero element postulated in A3 is unique, and for each a the fl of A4
is unique, and is called -a. Also Oa = 0, xO = 0, and (-I)a = -a. These
elementary consequences are considered in the exercises.
Our standard example of a vector space will be the set V = IRA of all realvalued functions on a set A under the natural operations of addition of two
functions and multiplication of a function by a number. This generalizes the
example lR(l,2,31 = 1R3 that we looked at above. Remember that a function f
in IRA is simply a mathematical object of a certain kind. We are saying that two
of these objects can be added together in a natural way to form a third such
object, and that the set of all such objects then satisfies the above laws for
addition. Of course, f
g is defined as the function whose value at a is f(a)
y(a), so that (f + g)(a) = f(a) + g(a) for all a in A. For example, in 1R3 we
defined the sum x y as that triple whose value at i is Xi Yi for all i. Similarly,
cf is the function defined by (cf)(a) = c(j(a») for all a. Laws Al through 84
follow at once from these definitions and the corresponding laws of algebra for
the real number system. For example, the equation (s
t)f = sf tf means

+ (tf)(a)

where we have used the definition of scalar multiplication in IRA, the distributive
law in IR, the definition of scalar multiplication in IRA, and the definition of
addition in IRA, in that order. Thus we have S2, and the other laws follow
similarly.
The set A can be anything at all. If A = IR, then V = IRR is the vector
space of all real-valued functions of one real variable. If A = IR X IR, then
V = IRRXR is the space of all real-valued functions of two real variables. If
A = {1,2} = 2, then V = 1R2 = 1R2 is the Cartesian plane, and if A =
{I, ... ,n} = ii, then V = IRn is Cartesian n-space. If A contains a single
point, then IRA is a natural bijective image of IR itself, and of course IR is trivially
a vector space with respect to its own operations.
Now let V be any vector space, and suppose that W is a nonempty subset of
V that is closed under the operations of V. That is, if a and {3 are in W, then so
is a
(3, and if a is in W, then so is Xa for every scalar x. For example, let V be
the vector space lR[a,bl of all real-valued functions on the closed interval [a, b) C IR,
and let W be the set e([a, b]) of all continuous real-valued functions on [a, b).
Then W is a subset of V that is closed under the operations of V, since f + g
and cf are continuous whenever f and g are. Or let V be Cartesian 2-space 1R2,
and let W be the set of ordered pairs x = -<XI, X2> such that Xl + X2 = O.
Clearly, W is closed under the operations of V.
Such a subset W is always a vector space in its own right. The universally
quantified laws AI, A2, and Sl through S4 hold in W because they hold in the
larger set V. And since there is some {3 in W, it follows that 0 = O{3 is in W
because W is closed under multiplication by scalars. For the same reason, if a
is in W, then so is -a = (-l)a. Therefore, A3 and A4 also hold, and we see
that W is a vector space. We have proved the following lemma.

+

W is a nonempty subset of a vector space V which is closed
under the operations of V, then W is itself a vector space.

Lelllilla. If

We call Wa subspace of V. Thus e([a, b]) is a subspace of lR[a,bl, and the
pairs -<Xl, X2> such that Xl + X2 = 0 form a subspace of 1R2. Subspaces will
be with us from now to the end.
A subspace of a vector space IRA is called a function space. In other words, a
function space is a collection of real-valued functions on a common domain
which is closed under addition and multiplication by scalars.
What we have defined so far ought to be called the notion of a real vector
space or a vector space over IR. There is an analogous notion of a complex vector
space, for which the scalars are the complex numbers. Then laws Sl through S4
refer to mUltiplication by complex numbers, and the space C A of all complex-

valued functions on A is the standard example. In fact, if the reader knew what
is meant by a field F, we could give a single general definition of a vector space
over F, where scalar multiplication is by the elements of F, and the standard
example is the space V = FA of all functions from A to F. Throughout this
book it will be understood that a vector space is a real vector space unless explicitly stated otherwise. However, much of the analysis holds as well for complex
vector spaces, and most of the pure algebra is valid for any scalar field F.

Linear combinations and linear span. Because of the commutative and associative laws for vector addition, the sum of a finite set of vectors is the same for all
possible ways of adding them. For example, the sum of the three vectors
aa, ab, a c can be calculated in 12 ways, all of which give the same result:

Therefore, if I = {a, b, c} is the set of indices used, the notation LiEI ai,
which indicates the sum without telling us how we got it, is unambiguous. In
general, for any finite indexed set of vectors {ai: i E l} there is a uniquely
determined sum vector LiEI ai which we can compute by ordering and grouping the a/s in any way.
The index set I is often a block of integers n = {1, ... ,n}. In this case
the vectors ai form an n-tuple {ai}~' and unless directed to do otherwise we
would add them in their natural order and write the sum as Li'=l ai. Note
that the way they are grouped is still left arbitrary.
Frequently, however, we have to use indexed sets that are not ordered.
For example, the general polynomial of degree at most 5 in the two variables
's' and 't' is

and the finite set of monomials {Siti}i+i:$5 has no natural order.

partial sums without showing how they were formed, since by our inductive

A vector {3 is called a linear combination of a subset A of the vector space V
if (3 is a finite sum L Xiai, where the vectors ai are all in A and the scalars Xi
are arbitrary. Thus, if A is the subset {tn}; C IRR of all "monomials", then a
function f is a linear combination of the functions in A if and only if f is a
polynomial function f(t) = L~ ci. If A is finite, it is often useful to take the
indexed set {ai} to be the whole of A, and to simply use a O-coefficient for any
vector missing from the sum. Thus, if A is the subset {sin t, cos t, et } of IR R ,
then we can consider A an ordered triple in the listed ordering, and the function
cos t
(-I)e t is the linear combination of the
3 sin t - et = 3· sin t
triple A having the coefficient triple -< 3, 0, -1>-.
Consider now the set L of all linear combinations of the two vectors
-< 1, 1, 1>- and -< 0, 1, -1>- in 1R3. It is the set of all vectors s -< 1, 1, 1>t -< 0, 1, -1>- = -< s, s t, s - t>-, where sand t are any real numbers. Thus
L = {-<s, s t, s - t>- : -<s, t>- E 1R2}. It will be clear on inspection that
L is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, and therefore is a subspace
of 1R3. Also, L contains each of the two given vectors, with coefficient pairs
-< 1, 0>- and -< 0, 1>-, respectively. Finally, any subspace M of 1R3 which
contains ·each of the two given vectors will also contain all of their linear combinations, and so will include L. That is, L is the smallest subspace of 1R3 containing
-< 1, 1, 1>- and -< 0, 1, -1>-. It is called the linear span of the two vectors, or the
subspace generated by the two vectors. In general, we have the following theorem.

VECTOR SPACES

Theorem 1.1. If A is a nonempty subset of a vector space V, then the set
L(A) of all linear combinations of the vectors in A is a subspace, and it is
the smallest subspace of V which includes the set A.

Proof. Suppose first that A is finite. We can assume that we have indexed A
in some way, so that A = {ai: i E I} for some finite index set I, and every
element of L(A) is of the form LiEI Xiai. Then we have
(L Xiai)

+

(L Yiai)

=

L (Xi

+ Yi)ai

+

because the left-hand side becomes Li (Xiai Yiai) when it is regrouped by
pairs, and then S2 gives the right-hand side. We also have
e(L Xiai) = L(exi)ai

by S3 and mathematical induction. Thus L(A) is closed under addition and
multiplication by scalars and hence is a subspace. Moreover, L(A) contains
each ai (why?) and so includes A. Finally, if a subspace W includes A, then it
contains each linear combination L Xiai, so it includes L(A). Therefore, L(A)
can be directly characterized as the uniquely determined smallest subspace
which includes the set A.
If A is infinite, we obviously can't use a single finite listing. However, the
sum (L~ Xiai) + (Lf Yj{3j) of two linear combinations of elements of A is
clearly a finite sum of scalars times elements of A. If we wish, we can rewrite it
as L~+m Xiai, where we have set (3j = an+j and Yj = xn+j for j = 1, ... , m.
In any case, L(A) is again closed under addition and multiplication by scalars
and so is a subspace. 0
We call L(A) the linear span of A. If L(A) = V, we say that A spans V;
V is finite-dimensional if it has a finite spanning set.
If V = JR3, and if 0\ 02 , and 03 are the "unit points on the axes", 01 =
-<1,0,0>-,0 2 = -<0,1,0>-, and 03 = -<0,0,1>-, then {Oi}r spans V, since
x= -<Xl, X2, X3>- = -<XllO,O>-<0,X2,0>-<0,0,X3>- = X101
X202
X303 = L~ XiO i for every x in JR3. More generally, if V = JRn and oj is
the n-tuple having 1 in the jth place and elsewhere, then we have similarly that
x = -< Xl, ... , Xn >- = Li'=l Xioi, so that {oi}l spans JR n. Thus JRn is finitedimensional. In general, a function space on an infinite set A will not be finitedimensional. For example, it is true but not obvious that e([a, bJ) has no finite
spanning set.

is a subspace, show that the linear span L(A) of a subset A of a vector space V is the

is sometimes taken as the definition of linear span.
1.37 By convention, the sum of an empty set of vectors is taken to be the zero vector.
This is necessary if Theorem 1.1 is to be strictly correct. Why? What about the
preceding problem?
Linear transformations. The general function space JRA and the subspace
e([a, bJ) of jR[a,bJ both have the property that in addition to being closed under

the vector operations, they are also closed under the operation of multiplication
of two functions. That is, the pointwise product of two functions is again a
function [(fg)(a) = f(a)g(a)J, and the product of two continuous functions is
continuous. With respect to these three operations, addition, multiplication,

30

1.1

VECTOR SPACES

and scalar multiplication, IRA and e([a, b]) are examples of algebras. If the reader
noticed this extra operation, he may have wondered why, at least in the context
of function spaces, we bother with the notion of vector space. Why not study
all three operations? The answer is that the vector operations are exactly the
operations that are "preserved" by many of the most important mappings of
sets of functions. For example, define T: e([a, b]) ~ IR by T(f) = f: f(t) dt.
Then the laws of the integral calculus say that T(f + g) = T(f) + T(g) and
T(cf) = cT(f). Thus T "preserves" the vector operations. Or we can say that T
"commutes" with the vector operations, since plus followed by T equals T
followed by plus. However, T does not preserve multiplication: it is not true in
general that T(fg) = T(f)T(g).
Another example is the mapping T: x ~ y from 1R3 to 1R2 defined by
YI = 2XI - X2 + X3, Y2 = Xl + 3X2 - 5X3, for which we can again verify
that T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) and T(cx) = cT(x). The theory of the solvability
of systems of linear equations is essentially the theory of such mappings T; thus
we have another important type of mapping that preserves the vector operations
(but not products).
These remarks suggest that we study vector spaces in part so that we can
study mappings which preserve the vector operations. Such mappings are
called linear transformations.
Definition. If V and Ware vector spaces, then a mapping T: V ~ W is a

In order to acquire a supply of examples, we shall find all linear transformations having IR n as domain space. It may be well to start by looking at one such
transformation. Suppose we choose some fixed triple of functions {Ii} ~ in the
space IRR of all real-valued functions on IR, say !I (t) = sin t, f 2(t) = cos t, and
fa(t) = et = exp(t). Then for each triple of numbers x = {xiH in 1R3 we have
the linear combination L~=l Xdi with {Xi} as coefficients. This is the element of
IRR whose value at t is L~ xiIi(t) = Xl sin t
X2 cos t X3et. Different coefficient
triples give different functions, and the mapping x 1-+ L~=l xdi = Xl sin
X2 cos X3 exp is thus a mapping from 1R3 to IRR. It is clearly linear. If we call
this mapping T, then we can recover the determining triple of functions from T
as the images of the "unit points" ~i in 1R3; T(~j) = L ~!Ii = Ii, and so
T(~l) = sin, T(~2) = cos, and T(~3) = expo We are going to see that every
linear mapping from 1R3 to IRR is of this form.
In the following theorem {~iH is the spanning set for IR n that we defined
earlier, so that x = Li Xi~i for every n-tuple x = <Xl, ••• , x n > in IRn.

then the "linear combination mapping" x 1-+ Li Xi~i is a linear transformation T from IR n to W, and T(~j) = ~j for j = 1, ... ,n. Conversely,
if T is any linear mapping from IR n to W, and if we set ~j = T(~j) for j =

Conversely, if T: IR n ~ W is linear, and if we set (3j = T(5 j ) for all j, then for
any x = -< Xb .•• , xn>- in IR n we have T(x) = T(L:i Xi 5i ) = L:i xiT( 5i ) =
L:i Xi{3i. Thus T is the mapping x ~ L:i xi{3i. 0
This is a tremendously important theorem, simple though it may seem, and
the reader is urged to fix it in his mind. To this end we shall invent some terminology that we shall stay with for the first three chapters. If a = {ab ... , an}
is an n-tuple of vectors in a vector space W, let La. be the corresponding linear
combination mapping x ~ L:i Xiai from IR n to W. Note that the n-tuple a
itself is an element of W n • If T is any linear mapping from IR n to W, we shall call
the n-tuple {T(5 i)} i the skeleton of T. In these terms the theorem can be restated
as follows.
Theorelll 1.2'. For each n-tuple a in W n , the map La.: IR n ~ W is linear
and its skeleton is a. Conversely, if T is any linear map from IR n to W, then

T = Lp where (3 is the skeleton of T.

Or again:
Theorelll 1.2". The map a ~ La. is a bijection from wn to the set of all
linear maps T from IR n to W, and T ~ skeleton (T) is its inverse.

A linear transformation from a vector space V to the scalar field IR is called
a linear functional on V. Thus f ~ f: f(t) dt is a linear f,unctional on V =
e([a, bJ). The above theorem is particularly simple for a linear functional F:
since W = IR, each vector (3i = F(5 i ) in the skeleton of F is simply a number bi ,
and the skeleton {b i } i is thus an element of IRn. In this case we would write
F(x) = L:i biXi, putting the numerical coefficient 'b/ before the variable
'xi'. Thus F(x) = 3x! - X2
4X3 is the linear functional on 1R3 with skeleton
-< 3, -1, 4>-. The set of all linear functionals on IR n is in a natural one-to-one
correspondence with IR n itself; we get b from F by bi = F(5 i ) for all i, and we
get F from b by F(x) = L: biXi for all x in IRn.
We next consider the case where the codomain space of T is a Cartesian
space IR m, and in order to keep the two spaces clear in our minds, we shall, for
the moment, take the domain space to be 1R3. Each vector (3i = T(5 i ) in the
skeleton of T is now an m-tuple of numbers. If we picture this m-tuple as a
column of numbers, then the three m-tuples {3i can be pictured as a rectangular
army of numbers, consisting of three columns each of m numbers. Let tij be the
ith number in the jth column. Then the doubly indexed set of numbers {tij} is
called the matrix of the transformation T. We call it an m-by-3 (an m X 3)
matrix because the pictured rectangular array has m rows and three columns.
The matrix determines T uniquely, since its columns form the skeleton of T.
The identity T(x) = L:~ x jT(5 j ) = L:~ Xj{3j allows the m-tuple T(x) to be
calculated explicitly from x and the matrix {tij}. Picture multiplying the
column m-tuple {3j by the scalar Xj and then adding across the three columns at

and this set of m scalar equations is equivalent to the one-vector equation
y = T(x).
We can now replace three by n in the above discussion without changing
anything except the diagram, and thus obtain the following specialization of
Theorem 1.2.
Theorelll 1.3. Every linear mapping T from IR n to IR m determines the
m X n matrix t = {tij} having the skeleton of T as its columns, and the
expression of the equation y = T(x) in linear combination form is equivalent

Conversely, each m X n matrix t determines the linear combination mapping
having the columns of t as its skeleton, and the mapping t 1---+ T is therefore
a bijection from the set of all m X n matrices to the set of all linear maps
from IR n to IRm.
A linear functional F on IR n is a linear mapping from IR n to IR 1, so it must
be expressed by a 1 X n matrix. That is, the n-tuple b in IR n which is the skeleton
of F is viewed as a matrix of one row and n columns.
As a final example of linear maps, we look at an important class of special
linear functionals defined on any function space, the so-called coordinate functionals. If V = IRI and i E I, then the ith coordinate functional 1ri is simply
evaluation at i, so that 1ri(f) = f(i). These functionals are obviously linear. In
fact, the vector operations on functions were defined to make them linear; since
sf tg is defined to be that function whose value at i is sf(i)
tg(i) for all i,
we see that sf tg is by definition that function such that 1ri(sf tg) =
S1ri(f)
t1ri(g) for all i!
If V is IR n , then 1rj is the mapping x = -<Xl> ... , x n >- 1---+ Xj. In this case
we know from the theorem that 1rj must be of the form 1rj(x) = L1 biXi for
some n-tuple b. What is b?

The general form of the linearity property, TeE Xiai) = L xiT(ai), shows
that T and T- l both carry subspaces into subspaces.
Theorem 1.4. If T: V ~ W is linear, then the T-image of the linear span
of any subset A C V is the linear span of the T-image of A: T[L(A)] =
L(T[AJ). In particular, if A is a subspace, then so is T[A]. Furthermore, if Y
is a subspace of W, then T-l[y] is a subspace of V.
Proof. According to the formula T(L Xiai) = L xiT(ai), a vector in W is
the T-image of a linear combination on A if and only if it is a linear combination
on T[A]. That is, T[L(A)] = L(T[AJ). If A is a subspace, then A = L(A) and
T[A] = L(T[AJ), a subspace of W. Finally, if Y is a subspace of Wand {ail C
T-lfY], then T(L Xiai) = L xiT(ai) E L(Y) = Y. Thus L Xiai E T-l[y]
and T-l[y] is its own linear span. 0

The subspace T-l(O) = {a E V: T(a) = O} is called the null space, or
kernel, of T, and is designated N(T) or meT). The range of T is the subspace
T[V] of W. It is designated R(T) or (!l(T).
Lemma 1.1. A linear mapping T is injective if and only if its null space
is {O}.
Proof. If T is injective, and if a rf 0, then T(a) rf T(O) = 0 and the null space
accordingly contains only O. On the other hand, if N(T) = {O}, then whenever
a rf {3, we have a - (3 rf 0, T(a) - T({3) = T(a - (3) rf 0, and T(a) rf T({3);
this shows that T is injective. 0

A linear map T: V ~ W which is bijective is called an isomorphism.
Two vector spaces V and Ware isomorphic if and only if there exists an isomorphism between them.
For example, the map -< Cl, ... , Cn >- ~ Lo- l Ci+1Xi is an isomorphism of
n
IR with the vector space of all polynomials of degree < n.
Isomorphic spaces "have the same form", and are identical as abstract
vector spaces. That is, they cannot be distinguished from each other solely on
the basis of vector properties which they do or do not have.
When a linear transformation is from V to itselfJ special things can happen.
One possibility is that T can map a vector a essentially to itself, T(a) = Xa
for some x in IR. In this case a is called an eigenvector (proper vector, characteristic vector), and x is the corresponding eigenvalue.

2. VECTOR SPACES AND GEOMETRY

The familiar coordinate systems of analytic geometry allow us to consider
geometric entities such as lines and planes in vector settings, and these geometric
notions give us valuable intuitions about vector spaces. Before looking at the
vector forms of these geometric ideas, we shall briefly review the construction of
the coordinate correspondence for three-dimensional Euclidean space. As usual,
the confident reader can skip it.
We start with the line. A coordinate correspondence between a line Land
the real number system IR is determined by choosing arbitrarily on L a zero
point 0 and a unit point Q distinct from O. Then to each point X on L is assigned
the number x such that JxJ is the distance from 0 to X, measured in terms of
the segment OQ as unit, and x is positive or negative according as X and Q are
on the same side of 0 or on opposite sides. The mapping X ~ x is the coordinate
correspondence. Now consider three-dimensional Euclidean space 1E3. We want
to set up a coordinate correspondence between 1E3 and the Cartesian vector
space 1R3. We first choose arbitrarily a zero point 0 and three unit points
Ql, Q2, and Q3 in such a way that the four points do not lie in a plane. Each of

1.2

VECTOR SPACES

GEOMETRY

A~D

37

the unit points Qi determines a line Li through 0 and a coordinate correspondence on this line, as defined above. The three lines L l , L 2, and L3 are called
the coordinate axes. Consider now any point X in 1E3. The plane through X
parallel to L2 and L3 intersects Ll at a point X b and therefore determines a
number Xl, the coordinate of Xl on L l . In a similar way, X determines points
X 2 on L2 and X 3 on L3 which have coordinates X2 and X3, respectively. Altogether X determines a triple

~_

in ~3, and we have thus defined a mapping
(): X ~ x from 1E3 to ~3 (see Fig. 1.4).
We call () the coordinate correspondence
defined by the axis system. The convention implicit in our notation above is that
()(Y) is y, ()(A) is a, etc. Note that the
unit point Ql on Ll has the coordinate
triple 01 = -< 1,0,0>, and similarly, that

There are certain basic facts about the coordinate correspondence that have
to be proved as theorems of geometry before the correspondence can be used to
treat geometric questions algebraically. These geometric theorems are quite
tricky, and are almost impossible to discuss adequately on the basis of the usual
secondary sch:)ol treatment of geometry. We shall therefore simply assume
them. They are:
1) () is a bijection from 1E3 to ~3.
2) Two line segments AB and XY are equal in length and parallel, and the
direction from A to B is the same as that from X to Y if and only if b - a =
y - X (in the vector space ~3). This relationship between line segments is
important enough to formalize. A directed line segment is a geometric line segment, together with a choice of one of the two directions along it. If we interpret
AB as the directed line segment from A to B, and if we define the directed line
segments AB and XY to be equivalent (and write AB ~ XV) if they are equal
in length, parallel, and similarly directed, then (2) can be restated:

AB

3) If X ~ 0, then Y is on the line through 0 and X in 1E3 if and only if

= tx for some t in R Moreover, this t is the coordinate of Y with respect to X

as unit point on the line through 0 and X.

4) If the axis system in 1E3 is Cartesian, that is, if the axes are mutually
perpendicular and a common unit of distance is used, then the length 10XI of
the segment OX is given by the so-called Euclidean norm on 1R 3 , 10XI =
CE~ Xi 2 )1/2. This follows directly from the Pythagorean theorem. Then this
formula and a second application of the Pythagorean theorem to the triangle
OXY imply that the segments OX and OY are perpendicular if and only if the
scalar product (x, y) = L~=l XiYi has the value 0 (see Fig. 1.5).
In applying this result, it is useful to note that the scalar product (x, y) is
linear as a function of either vector variable when the other is held fixed. Thus

Exactly the same theorems hold for the coordinate correspondence between
the Euclidean plane 1E2 and the Cartesian 2-space 1R2, except that now, of course,
(x, y) = L~ XiYi = XIYl
X2Y2·
We can easily obtain the equations for lines and
planes in 1E3 from these basic theorems. First, we see
from (2) and (3) that if fixed points A and B are given,
X
with A F- 0, then the line through B parallel to the
segment OA contains the point X if and only if there
0
exists a scalar t such that x - b = ta (see Fig. 1.6).
Therefore, the equation of this line is

+

x

= ta+ h.

Fig. 1.6

This vector equation is equivalent to the three numerical equations Xi =
ait bi , i = 1, 2, 3. These are customarily called the parametric equations of the
line, since they present the coordinate triple x of the varying point X on the line
as functions of the "parameter" t.

+

1.2

VECTOR SPACES AND GEOMETRY

Next, we know that the plane through B perpendicular to the direction of
the segment OA contains the point X if and only if BX 1. OA, and it therefore
follows from (2) and (4) that the plane contains X if and only if (x - b, a) = 0
(see Fig. 1.7). But (x - b, a) = (x, a) - (b, a) by the linearity of the scalar
product in its first variable, and if we set l = (b, a), we see that the equation of
the plane is
(x, a) = l

or

That is, a point X is on the plane through B perpendicular to the direction of
OA if and only if this equation holds for its coordinate triple x. Conversely,
if a ¢ 0, then we can retrace the steps taken above to show that the set of points
X in 1E3 whose coordinate triples x satisfy (x, a) = l is a plane.

Fig. 1.7

The fact that 1R3 has the natural scalar product (x, y) is of course extremely
important, both algebraically and geometrically. However, most vector spaces
do not have natural scalar products, and we shall deliberately neglect scalar
products in our early vector theory (but shall return to them in Chapter 5).
This leads us to seek a different interpretation of the equation L~ aiXi = l.
We saw in Section 1 that x 1---+ L~ aiXi is the most general linear functional f on
1R3. Therefore, given any plane 111 in 1E 3, there is a nonzero linear functional f
on 1R3 and a number l such that the equation of 111 is f(x) = l. And conversely,
given any nonzero linear functional f: IRa ~ IR and any l E IR, the locus of
I(x) = l is a plane M in 1E3. The reader will remember that we obtain the
coefficient triple a from f by ai = f(~i), since then f(x) = f(LI Xi~i) =

Ll3 x;J( ~i )

=

Lla Xiai·

Finally, we seek the vector form of the notion of parallel translation. In
plane geometry when we are considering two congruent figures that are parallel
and similarly oriented, we often think of obtaining one from the other by "sliding

40

VECTOR SPACES

1.2

the plane along itself" in such a way that all lines remain parallel to their original
positions. This description of a parallel translation of the plane can be more
elegantly stated as the condition that every directed line segment slides to an
equivalent one. If X slides to Y and 0 slides to B, then OX slides to BY, so
that OX ~ BY and x = y - b by (2). Therefore, the coordinate form of such
a parallel sliding is the mapping x ~ y = x + b.
Conversely, for any b in ~2 the plane mapping defined by x ~ y = x + b
is easily seen to be a parallel translation. These considerations hold equally well
for parallel translations of the Euclidean space 1E 3 •
It is geometrically clear that under a parallel translation planes map to
parallel planes and lines map to parallel lines, and now we can expect an easy
algebraic proof. Consider, for example, the plane 111 with equation f(x) = l;
let us ask what happens to 111 under the translation x ~ y = x + b. Since
x = y - b, we see that a point x is on 111 if and only if its translate y satisfies
the equation f(y - b) = lor, since f is linear, the equation f(y) = l', where
l' = l + f(b). But this is the equation of a plane N. Thus the translate of M
is the plane N.
It is natural to transfer all this geometric terminology from sets in 1E3
to the corresponding sets in ~3 and therefore to speak of the set of ordered
triples x satisfying f(x) = l as a set of points in ~3 forming a plane in ~3, and
to call the mapping x ~ x + b the (parallel) translation of ~3 through b, etc.
l\Ioreover, since ~3 is a vector space, we would expect these geometric ideas to
interplay with vector notions. For instance, translation through b is simply the
operation of adding the constant vector b: x ~ x + b. Thus if 111 is a plane, then
the plane N obtained by translating 111 through b is just the vector set sum
111 + b. If the equation of 111 is f(x) = l, then the plane 111 goes through 0 if
and only if l = 0, in which case 111 is a vector subspace of ~3 (the null space of f).
It is easy to see that any plane 111 is a translate of a plane through O. Similarly,
the line {ta + b : t E ~} is the translate through b of the line {ta : t E ~}, and
this second line is a subspace, the linear span of the one vector a. Thus planes
and lines in ~3 are translates of subspaces.

These notions all carryover to an arbitrary real vector space in a perfectly
satisfactory way and with additional dimensional variety. A plane in ~3
through 0 is a vector space which is two-dimensional in a strictly algebraic sense
which we shall discuss in the next chapter, and a line is similarly one-dimensional.
In ~3 there are no proper subspaces other than planes and lines through 0,
but in a vector space V with dimension n > 3 proper subspaces occur with all
dimensions from 1 to n - 1. We shall therefore use the term "plane" loosely to
refer to any translate of a subspace, whatever its dimension. More properly,
translates of vector subspaces are called affine subspaces.
We shall see that if V is a finite-dimensional space with dimension n, then
the null space of a nonzero linear functionalfis always (n - I)-dimensional, and
therefore it cannot be a Euclidean-like two-dimensional plane except when

n = 3. We use the term hyperplane for such a null space or one of its translates.
Thus, in general, a hyperplane is a set with the equation f(x) = l, where f is
a nonzero linear functional. It is a proper affine subspace (plane) which is maximal in the sense that the only affine subspace properly including it is the whole
of V. In ~3 hyperplanes are ordinary geometric planes, and in ~2 hyperplanes
are lines!

PRODUCT SPACES AND HOM(V, W)

3. PRODUCT SPACES AND HOM(V, W)

Product spaces. If W is a vector space and A is an arbitrary set, then the set

V = W A of all W-valued functions on A is a vector space in "exactly the same
way that ~A is. Addition is the natural addition of functions, (f + g) (a) =
f(a) + g(a), and, similarly, (xf)(a) = x(j(a) for every function f and scalar x.
Laws Al through S4 follow just as before and for exactly the same reasons. For
variety, let us check the associative law for addition. The equation! + (g + h) =
(f + g) + h means that (j + (g + h)(a) = ((f + g) + h) (a) for all a E A.
But
(j + (g

+ h)

+ (g + h)(a)
+ (g(a) + h(a)
(f + g)(a) + h(a) =

(a) = f(a)
= f(a)

=

=

((f

(j(a) + g(a) + h(a)
+ g) + h) (a),

where the middle equality in this chain of five holds by the associative law for W
and the other four are applications of the definition of addition. Thus the
associative law for addition holds in W A because it holds in W, and the other
laws follow in exactly the same way. As before, we let 7ri be evaluation at i,
so that 7ri(f) = f(i). Now, however, 7ri is vector valued rather than scalar valued,
because it is a mapping from V to W, and we call it the ith coordinate projection
rather than the ith coordinate functional. Again these maps are all linear.
In fact, as before, the natural vector operations on W A are uniquely defined by
the requirement that the projections 7ri all be linear. We call the value fU) =
7r j(f) the jth coordinate of the vector f. Here the analogue of Cartesian n-space
is the set wn of all n-tuples a = -< al, ... , a n >- of vectors in W; it is also
designated W n • Clearly, aj is the jth coordinate of the n-tuple a.
There is no reason why we must use the same space W at each index, as we
did above. In fact, if W b . . . , W n are any n vector spaces, then the set of all
n-tuples a = -<ab ... , a n >- such that aj E Wj for j = 1, ... , n is a vector
space under the same definitions of the operations and for the same reasons.
That is, the Cartesian product W = W 1 X W 2 X ... X W n is also a vector
space of vector-valued functions. Such finite products will be very important
to us. Of course, ~n is the product IIi Wi with each Wi = ~; but ~n can also
be considered ~m X ~n-m, or more generally, IIf Wi, where Wi = ~mi and
L:f mi = n. However, the most important use of finite product spaces arises
from the fact that the study of certain phenomena on a vector space V may
lead in a natural way to a collection {ViH of subspaces of V such that V is
isomorphic to the product IIi Vi. Then the extra structure that V acquires
when we regard it as the product space IIi Vi is used to study the phenomena
in question. This is the theory of direct sums, and we shall investigate it in
Section 5.
Later in the course we shall need to consider a general Cartesian product of
vector spaces. We remind the reader that if {Wi: i E J} is any indexed collection
of vector spaces, then the Cartesian product IIiEI Wi of these vector spaces is

44

1.3

VECTOR SPACES

defined as the set of all functions f with domain I such that f(i) E Wi for all
i E I (see Section 0.8).
The following is a simple concrete example to keep in mind. Let S be the
ordinary unit sphere in 1R 3 , S = {x: L~ x~ = I}, and for each point x on S
let W" be the subspace of 1R3 tangent to S at x. By this we mean the subspace
(plane through 0) parallel to the tangent plane to S at x, so that the translate
W" + x is the tangent plane (see Fig. 1.8). A function f in the product space
W = II"es W" is a function which assigns to each point x on S a vector in W",
that is, a vector parallel to the tangent plane to Sat x. Such a function is called
a vector field on S. Thus the product set W is the set of all vector fields on S,
and W itself is a vector space, as the next theorem states.

Fig. 1.8

Of course, the jth coordinate projection on W = IIiES Wi is evaluation
at j, 7rj(f) = f(j), and the natural vector operations on Ware uniquely defined
by the requirement that the coordinate projections all be linear. Thus f + g
must be that element of W whose value at j, 7rj(f + g), is 7rj(f) + 7rj(g) =
f(j) + g(j) for all j E I, and similarly for mUltiplication by scalars.
Theorem. 3.1. The Cartesian product of a collection of vector spaces can
be made into a vector space in exactly one way so that the coordinate projections are all linear.
Proof. With the vector operations determined uniquely as above, the proofs of
Al through S4 that we sampled earlier hold verbatim. They did not require that
the functions being added have all their values in the same space, but only that
the values at a given domain element i all lie in the same space. 0
Hom.(V, W). Linear transformations have the simple but important properties

that the sum of two linear transformations is linear and the composition of two
linear transformations is linear. These imprecise statements are in essence the
theme of this section, although they need bolstering by conditions on domains
and codomains. Their proofs are simple formal algebraic arguments, but the
objects being discussed will increase in conceptual complexity.

1.3

PRODUCT SPACES AND HOM(V.

W)

If W is a vector space and A is any set, we know that the space W A of all
mappings f: A -+ W is a vector space of functions (now vector valued) in the
same way that IRA is. If A is itself a vector space V, we naturally single out for
special study the subset of WV consisting of all linear mappings. We designate
this subset Hom(V, W). The fonowing elementary theorems summarize its
basic algebraic properties.
TheoreIn 3.2. Hom(V, W) is a vector subspace of WV.

Pl·oof. The theorem is an easy formality. If Sand T are in Hom(V, W), then

(S

+ T)(xa. + y(3) =
= xS(a.)

S(xa. + y,8) + T(xa. + y,8)
+ yS(,8) + xT(a.) + yT(,8) =

xeS + T)(a.)

+ yeS + T)(,8),

so S + T is linear and Hom(V, W) is closed under addition. The reader should
be sure he knows the justification for each step in the above continued equality.
The closure of Hom(V, W) under multiplication by scalars fonows similarly,
and since Hom(V, W) contains the zero transformation, and so is nonempty,
it is a subspace. 0
TheoreIn 3.3. The composition of linear maps is linear: if T E Hom(V, W)
and S E Hom(W, X), then SoT E Hom(V, X). Moreover, composition
is distributive over addition, under the obvious hypotheses on domains and
codomains:

(Sl

+ S2)

0

T

=

SloT + S2

0

T

and

So (Tl

+ T 2) =

So Tl

0

T 2.

Finally, composition commutes with scalar multiplication:
C(S

Proof. We have

So T(xa.

+ yS(T(,8»)

so SoT is linear. The two distributive laws will be left to the reader. 0
Corollary. If T E Hom(V, W) is fixed, then composition on the right by T
is a linear transformation from the vector space Hom(W, X) to the vector
space Hom(V, X). It is an isomorphism if T is an isomorphism.

P1'Oof. The algebraic properties of composition stated in the theorem can be
combined as follows:

+

(ClSl C2S2) 0 T = Cl(Sl 0 T)
So (clTl
C2T2) = Cl(S 0 T 1 )

+

+ C2(S2
+ C2(S

T),
T2)'

The first equation says exactly that composition on the right by a fixed T is a
linear transformation. (Write SoT as 3(S) if the equations still don't look
right.) If T is an isomorphism, then composition by T- l "undoes" composition
by T, and so is its inverse. 0

46

1.3

VECTOR SPACES

The second equation implies a similar corollary about composition on the
left by a fixed S.
TheoreIn 3.4. If W is a product vector space, W = IIi Wi, then a mapping
T from a vector space V to W is linear if and only if 7ri 0 T is linear for
each coordinate projection 7ri.
Proof. If T is linear, then 7ri

0

T is linear by the above theorem. Now suppose,
0 T are linear.
Then

conversely, that all the maps 7ri
7ri(T(xa

+ y(3»)

=

7ri

0

+ y(3) =

T(xa
=

X(7ri

But if 7ri(f) = 7ri(g) for all i, then f
yT({3), and T is linear. 0

=

g.

0

T)(a)

+ Y(7ri

+ Y7ri(T({3»)
Therefore,

0

T)({3)

+ yT({3»).
T(xa + y(3) = xT(a) +
= 7ri(xT(a)

If T is a linear mapping from ~n to W whose skeleton is {{3j} n, then 7ri 0 T
has skeleton {7ri({3j)}f=l. If W is ~m, then 7ri is the ith coordinate functional
y 1---+ Yi, and (3j is the jth column in the matrix t = {tij} of T. Thus 7ri({3j) = tij,
and 7ri 0 T is the linear functional whose skeleton is the ith row of the matrix of T.
In the discussion centering around Theorem 1.3, we replaced the vector
equation y = T(x) by the equivalent set of m scalar equations Yi = L:f=l tijXj,
which we obtained by reading off the ith coordinate in the vector equation. But
in "reading off" the ith coordinate we were applying the coordinate mapping
7ri, or in more algebraic terms, we were replacing the linear map T by the set of
linear maps {7ri 0 T}, which is equivalent to it by the above theorem.
Now consider in particular the space Hom(V, V), which we may as well
designate 'Hom(V)'. In addition to being a vector space, it is also closed under
composition, which we consider a multiplication operation. Since composition
of functions is always associative (see Section 0.9), we thus have for multiplication the laws
A 0 (B 0 C) = (A 0 B) 0 C,
A 0 (B
C) = (A 0 B)
(A 0 C),
(A
B) 0 C = (A 0 C)
(B 0 C),
k(A 0 B) = (kA) 0 B = A 0 (kB).

+

+

+
+

Any vector space which has in addition to the vector operations an operation
of multiplication related to the vector operations in the above ways is called
an algebra. Thus,
TheoreIn 3.5. Hom(V) is an algebra.
We noticed earlier that certain real-valued function spaces are also algebras.
Examples were ~A and e([O, 1]). In these cases multiplication is commutative,
but in the case of Hom(V) multiplication is not commutative unless V is a
trivial space (V = {O}) or V is isomorphic to~. We shall check this later when
we examine the finite-dimensional theory in greater detail.

PRODUCT SPACES AND HOM(V, W)

Product projections and injections. In addition to the coordinate projections,

there is a second class of simple linear mappings that is of basic importance in
the handling of a Cartesian product space W = IIkEK Wk. These are, for each
j, the mapping OJ taking a vector a E W j to the function in the product space
having the value a at the index j and elsewhere. For example, O2 for WI X
W 2 X W3 is the mapping a ~ -<0, a, 0> from W 2 to W. Or if we view ~3 as
~ X ~2, then O2 is the mapping -< X2, X3 > ~ -< 0, -< X2, X3> > = -< 0, X2, X3 > .
We call OJ the injection of Wj into IIk Wk. The linearity of OJ is probably obvious.
The mappings 7r j and OJ are clearly connected, and the following pl'Ojectioninjection identities state their exact relationship. If I j is the identity transformation on Wj, then

and

If K is finite and I is the identity on the product space W, then

= I.

In the case IIt=l Wi, we have 02 0 11'2(-<aI, a2, a3» = -<0, a2, 0>, and
the identity simply says that -< aI, 0, >
-< 0, a2, >
-< 0, 0, a3> =
-< aI, a2, a3> for all aI, a2, a3' These identities will probably be clear to the
reader, and we leave the formal proofs as an exercise.
The coordinate projections 11'j are useful in the study of any product space,
but because of the limitation in the above identity, the injections OJ are of
interest principally in the case of finite products. Together they enable us to
decompose and reassemble linear maps whose domains or codomains are finite
product spaces.
For a simple example, consider the T in Hom(~3, ~2) whose matrix is

°

[i

°

+

+

-1
1

Then 11'1 0 T is the linear functional whose skeleton -< 2, -1, 1> is the first row
in the matrix of T, and we know that we can visualize its expression in equation
X3, as being obtained from the vector equation y =
form, Yl = 2Xl - X2
T(x) by "reading off the first row". Thus we "decompose" T into the two linear
functionals li = 11'i 0 T. Then, speaking loosely, we have the reassembly
T = -< h, l2> j more exactly, T(x) = -< 2Xl - X2
X3, Xl
X2
4X3> =
-< II (x), l2(X) > for all x. However, we want to present this reassembly as the
action of the linear maps 01 and O2 . We have

+

+

+ +

which shows that the decomposition and reassembly of T is an expression of the
identity L Oi 0 11'i = I. In general, if T E Hom(V, W) and W = IIi Wi, then
Ti = 11'; 0 T is in Hom(V, Wi) for each i, and Ti can be considered "the part
of T going into W/', since Ti(a) is the ith coordinate of T(a) for each a. Then we

48

1.3

VECTOR SPACES

can reassemble the T/s to form T again by T = L Oi 0 T i, for L Oi 0 Ti =
(L Oi 0 'Tri) 0 T = loT = T. Moreover, any finite collection of T/s on a
common domain can be put together in this way to make a T. For example,
we can assemble an m-tuple {Ti} of linear maps on a common domain V to
form a single m-tuple-valued linear map T. Given a in V, we simply define
T(a) as that m-tuple whose ith coordinate is Ti(a) for i = 1, ... , m, and then
check that T is linear. Thus without having to calculate, we see from this
assembly principle that T: x ~ -< 2XI - X2
X3, Xl
X2
4X3>- is a linear
mapping from 1R3 to 1R2, since we have formed T by assembling the two linear
X3 and l2(X) = Xl
X2
4X3 to form a
functionals ll(X) = 2XI - X2
single ordcrcd-pair-valued map. This very intuitive proccss has an cqually
simple formal justification. We rigorize our discussion in the following theorem.

r

Theorem 3.6. If Ti is in Hom(V, Wi) for each i in a finite index set I,
and if W is the product space IIiEI Wi, then there is a uniquely determined
Tin Hom(V, W) such that Ti = 'Tri 0 T for all i in I.
Proof. If T exists such that Ti =

T for each i, then T

T

(L Oi 'Tri) T = L Oi (7ri T) = L Oi T i. Thus T is uniquely determincd

In the same way, we can decompose a linear T whose domain is a product
space V = II;'=1 V j into the maps T j = To OJ with domains Vj, and thcn
reassemble these maps to form T by the identity T = L;'=l T j 0 'Trj (check it
mentally!). lVloreover, a finite collection of maps into a common codomain
space can be put together to form a single map on the product of the domain
spaces. Thus an n-tuple of maps {Ti} ~ into W defines a single map T into W,
where the domain of T is the product of the domains of the T/s, by the equation
T( -< aI, ... , an >-) = L~ Ti(ai) or T = L~ Ti 0 'Tri. For example, if T I: IR ~ 1R2
is the map t ~ t -< 2, 1 >- = -< 2t, t>-, and T 2 and T 3 are similarly the maps
t ~ t -< -1, 1>- and t ~ t -< 1,4>-, then T = Lt Ti 0 7ri is the mapping from
1R3 to 1R2 whose matrix is

Again there is a simple formal argument, and we shall ask the reader to write
out the proof of the following theorem.
Theorem 3.7. If T j is in Hom(Vj, W) for each J in a finite index set J,
and if V = IIjEJ Vi> then there exists a unique T in Hom(V, W) such
that To OJ = T j for eachJ in J.
Finally we should mention that Theorem 3.6 holds for all product spaces,
finite or not, and states a property that characterizes product spaces. We shall

1.3

49

PRODUCT SPACES AND HOM(V, W)

investigate this situation in the exercises. The proof of the general case of
Theorem 3.6 has to get along without the injections OJ; instead, it is an application
of Theorem 3.4.
The reader may feel that we are being overly formal in using the projections
7ri and the injections Oi to give algebraic formulations of processes that are
easily visualized directly, such as reading off the scalar "components" of a
vector equation. However, the mappings
and

4. AFFINE SUBSPACES AND QUOTIENT SPACES

In this section we shall look at the "planes" in a vcctor space V and see what
happens to them when we translate them, intersect them with each other,
take their images under linear maps, and so on. Then we shall confine ourselves
to the set of all planes that are translates of a fixed subspace and discover that
this set itself is a vector space in the most obvious way. Some of this material
has been anticipated in Section 2.
Affine subspaces. If N is a subspace of a vector space V and a is any vector
of V, then the set N
a = {~+ a : ~ EN} is called either the coset of N
containing a or the affine subspace of V through a and parallel to N. The set N a

+

+

is also called the translate of N through a. We saw in Section 2 that affine subspaces are thc general objects that we want to call planes. If N is given and fixed
in a discussion, we shall use the notation a = N
a (see Section 0.12).
We begin with a list of some simple properties of affine subspaces. Some of
these will gencralize observations already made in Section 2, and the proofs of
some will be left as exercises.
1) With a fixed subspace N assumed, if 'Y E a, then 'Y = a. For if 'Y =
a + 7]0, then 'Y + 7] = a + (7]0 + 7]) E a, so 'Y Ca. Also a + 7] = 'Y + (7] - 7]0) E 'Y,
soaC'Y. Thusa= 'Y.
2) With N fixed, for any a and {3, either a = 11 or a and 11 are disjoint.
For if a and 11 are not disjoint, then there exists a 'Y in each, and a = 'Y = 11
by (1). The reader may find it illuminating to compare these calculations with
the more general ones of Section 0.12. Here a ~ {3 if and only if a - (3 EN.
3) Now let a be the collection of all affine subspaces of V; a is thus the set
of all cosets of all vector subspaces of V. Then the intersection of any sub-

+

1.4

53

family of Ci is either empty or itself an affine subspace. In fact, if [Ai} iEI is
an indexed collection of affine subspaces and Ai is a coset of the vector subspace
Wi for each i E I, then niEI Ai is either empty or a coset of the vector subspace
niEI Wi. For if {3 E niEI Ai, then (1) implies that Ai = {3
Wi for all i, and
then nAi = (3
nWi.
4) If A, BE Ci, then A + BE Ci. That is, the set sum of any two affine
subspaces is itself an affine ~mbspace.
5) If A E Ci and T E Hom(V, W), then T[A] is an affine subspace of W.
In particular, if t E IR, then tA E Ci.
6) If B is an affine subspace of Wand T E Hom(V, TV), then T- 1 [B] is
either empty or an affine subspace of V.
7) For a fixed a E V the translation of V through a is the mapping
Sa: V ~ V defined by Sa(~) = ~
a for all ~ E V. Translation is not linear;
for example, Sa(O) = a. It is clear, however, that translation carries affine
subspaces into affine subspaces. Thus Sa(A) = A + a and Sa({3 + W) =
(a
(3)
W.
8) An affine transformation from a vector space V to a vector space W is a
linear mapping from V to W followed by a translation in W. Thus an affine
transformation is of the form ~ f-+ T(~)
(3, where T E Hom(V, W) and (3 E W.
Note that ~ f-+ T(~ a) is affine, since

+

+

+

+ +

+
T(~ + a) =

+

T(~)

+ {3,

where

(3 = T(a).

It follows from (5) and (7) that an affine transformation carries affine
subspaces of V into affine subspaces of W.
Now fix a subspace N of V, and consider the set W of all
translates (cosets) of N. We are going to see that W itself is a vector space in
the most natural way possible. Addition will be set addition, and scalar multiplication will be set multiplication (except in one special case). For example, if N
is a line through the origin in 1R 3, then W consists of all lines in 1R3 parallel to N.
Weare saying that this set of parallel lines will automatically turn out to be a
vector space: the set sums of any two of the lines in W turn out to be a line in W!
And if LEW and t ~ 0, then the set product tL is a line in W. The translates
of L fiber 1R 3 , and the set of fibers is a natural vector space.
During this discussion it will be helpful temporarily to indicate set sums by
'+s' and set products by I •• '. With N fixed, it follows from (2) above that two
eosets are disjoint or identical, so that the set W of all cosets is a fibering of V
in the general case, just as it was in our example of the parallel lines. From (4)
or by a direct calculation we know that ex +. II = a + (3. Thus W is closed
under set addition, and, naturally, we take this to be our operation of addition
on W. That is, we define + on W by ex + II = ex +. II. Then the natural map
7r: a f-+ ex from V to W preserves addition, 7r(a (3) = 7r(a)
7r({3), since
Quotient space.

+

this is just our equation a
{3 = a
~ above. Similarly, if t EO IR, then the
set product t . s a is either ta or {O]. Hence if we define ta as the set product when
t ,e 0 and as 0 = N when t = 0, then 7r also preserves scalar multiplication,
7r(ta)

= t7r(a).

We thus have two vectorlike operations on the set W of all cosets of N,
and we naturally expect W to turn out to be a vector space. We could prove this
by verifying all the laws, but it is more elegant to notice the general setting for
such a verification proof.
Theorem 4.1. Let V be a vector space, and let W be a set having two

vectorlike operations, which we designate in the usual way. Suppose that
there exists a surjective mapping T: V --+ W which preserves the operations:
T(sa
t(3) = sT(a)
tT({3). Then W is a vector space.

+

+

Proof. We have to check laws Al through S4. However, one example should
make it clear to the reader how to proceed. We show that T(O) satisfies A3 and
hence is the zero vector of lV. Since every (3 EO W is of the form T(a), we have
T(O)

+ (3 =

T(O)

+ T(a)

= T(O + a) = T(a) =

(3,

which is A3. We shall ask the reader to check more of the laws in the exercises. 0
Theorem 4.2. The set of cosets of a fixed subspace N of a vector space V

themselves form a vector space, called the quotient space V IN, under the
above natural operations, and the projection 7r is a surjective linear map
from V to V IN.
Theorem 4.3. If T is in Hom(V, W), and if the null space of T includes the
subspace lIf C V, then T has a unique factorization through V I lIf. That is,

there exists a unique transformation S in Hom(V1M, W) such that T =
S07r.

Proof. Since T is zero on lIf, it follows that T is constant on each coset A of lIf,
so that T[A] contains only one vector. If we define S(A) to be the unique
vector in T[A], then S(a) = T(a), so So 7r = T by definition. Conversely, if
T = R 0 7r, then R(a) = R 0 7r(a) = T(a), and R is our above S. The linearity
of S is practically obvious. Thus
S(a

+ m=

S(a

+ (3) =

T(a

+ (3) =

T(a)

+ T({3)

= S(a)

+ S(m,

and homogeneity follows similarly. This completes the proof. 0
One more remark is of interest here. If N is invariant under a linear map
T in Hom V (that is, T[N] eN), then for each a in V, T[a] is a subset of the
coset T(a), for
T[a]

4.14 If we remember that the linear span 1.,(.1) of a subset .1 of a vector space V can
be defined as the intersection of all the subspaces of V that include .1, then the fact
that the intersection of any collection of affine subspaces of a vector space V is either
an affine subspace or empty suggests that we define the affine span .1J(A) of a nonempty
subset A C V as the intersection of all affine subspaces including A. Then we know
from (3) in our list of affine properties that .1J(.I) is an affine subspace, and by its
definition above that it is the smallest affine subspace including A. We now naturally
wonder whether M(A) can be directly described in terms of linear combinations.

5. DIRECT SUMS

We come now to the heart of the chapter. It frequently happens that the study
of some phenomenon on a vector space V leads to a finite collection of subspaces
{Vi} such that V is naturally isomorphic to the product space IIi Vi. Under
this isomorphism the maps (h 0 7r i on the product space become certain maps
Pi in Hom V, and the projection-injection identities are reflected in the identities
"'£Pi = I, P j 0 P j = P j for all .1, and Pi 0 P j = 0 if i ¢ i Also, Vi = range
Pi. The product structure that V thus acquires is then used to study the phenomenon that gave rise to it. For example, this is the way that we unravel the
structure of a linear transformation in Hom V, the study of which is one of the
central problems in linear algebra.
SUIllS. If VI, ... , V n are subspaces of the vector space V, then the
mapping 7r: <aI,"" a n >- ~ "'£7 ai is a linear transformation from II~ Vi
to V, since it is the sum 7r = "'£7 7ri of the coordinate projections.

Direct

Definition. We shall say that the Vi's are independent if 7r is injective and

that V is the direct sum of the Vi's if 7r is an isomorphism. We express the
latter relationship by writing V = VI EEl ... EEl V n = EB7 Vi.
Thus V = EBi=I Vi if and only if 7r is injective and surjective, i.e., if and
only if the subspaces {Vig are both independent and span V. A useful restate-

1.5

57

DIRECT SUMS

ment of the direct sum condition is that each a E V is uniquely expressible as
a sum :E~ ai, with ai E Vi for all i; a has some such expression because the V/s
span V, and the expression is unique by their independence.
For example, let V = e(lR) be the space of real-valued continuous functions
on IR, let V. be the subset of even functions (functions f such that f( -x) = f(x)
for all x), and let Vo be the subset of odd functions (functions such that f( -x) =
-f(x) for all x). It is clear that V. and Vo are subspaces of V, and we claim that
V = V. EB Yo' To see this, note that for any f in V, O(x) = (j(x) f( -x))/2
is even, h(x) = (j(x) - f( -x)) /2 is odd, and f = 0 h. Thus V = V.
Yo'
Moreover, this decomposition of f is unique, for if f = 01
hI also, where 01
is even and hI is odd, then 0 - 01 = hI - h, and therefore 0 - 01 = 0 =
hI - h, since the only function that is both even and odd is zero. The even-odd
components of eX are the hyperbolic cosine and sine functions:

proper subspaces one of which is a plane and the other a line not lying in that
plane, then M and N are complementary subspaces. Moreover, these are
nontrivial complementary pairs in IRs, The rea.der will be asked to prove
some of these facts in the exercises and they all will be clear by the middle of
the next chapter.
The following lemma is technically useful.
Lemma 5.3. If 171 and Vo are independent subspaces of 17 and {Yin are
independent subspaces of Yo, then {Vi}'; are independent subspaces of V.

Proof. If ai E Vi for all i and 2:1 ai = 0, then, setting ao = 2:2 ai, we have
ao = 0, with ao E Yo. Therefore, a 1 = ao = 0 by the independence of

Definition. We call aj the jth component of a, and we call the linear map

P j = 7rj 0 7r- 1 the projection of V onto Vi (with respect to the given direct
sum decomposition of V). Since each a in V is uniquely expressible as a sum
a = 2:1 ai, with ai in Vi for all i, we can view Pj(a) = aj as "the part of
a in V;".

This use of the word "projection" is different from its use in the Cartesian
product situation, and each is different from its use in the quotient space context (Section 0.12). It is apparent that these three uses are related, and the
ambiguity causes little confusion since the proper meaning is always clear from
the context.

The above projection properties are clearly the reflection in V of the projection-injection identities for the isomorphic space IIi Vi.
A converse theorem is also true.

span V. Next, if fJ E Vj, then Pi(fJ) = 0 for i ¢ j, since fJ E range P j and
Pi 0 P j = 0 if i ¢ j.
Then also P;({3) = (I - Ei+j P i )({3) = 1({3) = (3.
Now consider a = Ei ai for any choice of ai E Vi. Using the above two facts,
we have Pj(a) = Pj(E?=l ai) = Ei=l Pj(ai) = aj. Therefore, a = 0 implies
that aj = Pj(O) = 0 for all j, and the subspaces Vi are independent.
Consequently, V = EBi Vi. Finally, the fact that a = E PiCa) and PiCa) E Vi
for all i shows that P j(a) is the jth component of a for every a and therefore that
P j is the projection of V onto Vj. 0

There is an intrinsic characterization of the kind of map that is a projection.
Lelllllla 5.4. The projections Pi are idempotent (Pr = Pi), or, equivalently,
each is the identity on its range. The null space of Pi is the sum of the spaces
V j for j ¢ i.

Proof. PJ = P j 0 (I - Ei+j Pi) = P j 0 I = Pj. Since this can be rewritten
as Pj(Pj(a» = Pj(a) for every a in V, it says exactly that P j is the identity
on its range.
Now set Wi = Ei+i V;, and note that if (3 E Wi, then P i ({3) = 0 since
Pi[Vj] = 0 for j ¢ i. Thus Wi C N(P i ). Conversely, if PiCa) = 0, then a =
lea) = Ei Pj(a) = Ej+i Pj(a) E Wi. Thus N(Pi) C Wi, and the two spaces
are equal. 0

Conversely:
Lelllllla 5.5. If P E Hom(V) is idempotent, then V is the direct sum of its

range and null space, and P is the corresponding projection on its range.
Proof. Setting Q = I - P, we have PQ = P - p 2 = O. Therefore, V is the
direct sum of the ranges of P and Q, and P is the corresponding projection on its
range, by the above theorem. Moreover, the range of Q is the null space of P,
by the coronary. 0

If V = M E9 Nand P is the corresponding projection on M, we call P the
p1"Ojection on M along N. The projection P is not determined by M alone, since

M does not determine N. A pair P and Q in Hom V such that P
PQ = QP = 0 is called a pair of complementary projections.

In the above discussion we have neglected another fine point. Strictly
speaking, when we form the sum 7r = L~ 7r i, we are treating each 7r j as though
it were from II~ Vi to V, whereas actually the codomain of 7rj is Vj. And we
want P j to be from V to V, whereas 7rj 0 7r- 1 has codomain Vj, so the equation
P j = 7rj 0 7r- 1 can't quite be true either. To repair these flaws we have to
introduce the injection Lj: Vj ---+ V, which is the identity map on Vj, but which
views V j as a subspace of V and so takes Vas its codomain. If our concept of a
mapping includes a codomain possibly larger than the range, then we have to
admit such identity injections. Then, setting ifj = Lj 0 7rj, we have the correct
equations 7r = L~ ifi and P j = ifj 0 7r- 1 •

On solving a linear equation. 1\fany important problems in mathematics are

in the following general form. A linear operator T: V ---t W is given, and for a
given 1/ E W the equation T(~) = 1/ is to be solved for ~ E V. In our terms, the
condition that there exist a solution is exactly the condition that 1/ be in the
range space of T. In special circumstances this condition can be given more or
less useful equivalent alternative formulations. Let us suppose that we know
how to recognize R(T), in which case we may as well make it the new codomain,
and so assume that T is surjective. There still remains the problem of determining what we mean by solving the equation. The universal principle running
through all the important instances of the problem is that a solution process
calculates a right inverse to T, that is, a linear operator S: W ---t V such that
To S = I w , the identity on W. Thus a solution process picks one solution
vector ~ E V for each 1/ E W in such a way that the solving ~ varies linearly with
1/. Taking this as our meaning of solving, we have the following fundamental
reformulation.
TheoreIll 5.3. Let T be a surjective linear map from the vector space V

to the vector space W, and let N be its null space. Then a subspace M is a
complement of N if and only if the restriction of T to M is an isomorphism
from M to W. The mapping M ~ (T M)-1 is a bijection from the set
of all such complementary subspaces M to the set of all linear right inverses
of T.

Proof. It should be clear that a subspace M is the range of a linear right inverse
of T (a map S such that T 0 S = I w) if and only if T M is an isomorphism to W,
in which caseS = (T M)-l. Strictly speaking, the right inverse must be from
W to V and therefore must be R = LM 0 S, where LM is the identity injection
from M to V. Then (R 0 T)2 = R 0 (T 0 R) 0 T = R 0 Iw 0 T = RoT, and
RoT is a projection whose range is M and whose null space is N (since R is
injective). Thus V = M Ef) N. Conversely, if V = M Ef) N, then T M is
injective because JI.f n N = {O} and surjective because M
N = V implies
that W = T[V] = T[JI.f N] = T[M]
T[N] = T[M]
{O} = T[M]. 0

Polynomials in T. The material in this subsection will be used in our study of

differential equations with constant coefficients and in the proof of the diagonalizability of a symmetric matrix. In linear algebra it is basic in almost any
approach to the canonical forms of matrices.
If PI(t) = Lo ai and P2(t) = Lo bjt j are any two polynomials, then their

where Ck = Li+j=k aibj = Lf=o aibk-i. N ow let T be any fixed element of
Hom(V), and for any polynomial q(t) let q(T) be the transformation obtained
by replacing t by T. That is, if q(t) = L~ Cktk, then q(T) = L~ CkTk, where, of
course, Tl is the composition product ToT 0 • • • 0 T with l factors. Then the
bilinearity of composition (Theorem 3.3) shows that if p(t) = PI (t)P2(t),
then p(T) = PI(T) 0 P2(T). In particular, any two polynomials in T commute
with each other under composition. More simply, the commutative law for
addition implies that
if p(t) = PI(t)

+ P2(t),

then p(T) = PI(T)

+ P2(T).

The mapping p(t) 1---+ p(T) from the algebra of polynomials to the algebra
Hom(V) thus preserves addition, multiplication, and (obviously) scalar mUltiplication. That is, it preserves all the operations of an algebra and is therefore
what is called an (algebra) homomorphism.
The word "homomorphism" is a general term describing a mapping 8
between two algebraic systems of the same kind such that 8 preserves the
operations of the system. Thus a homomorphism between vector spaces is
simply a linear transformation, and a homomorphism between groups is a
mapping preserving the one group operation. An accessible, but not really
typical, example of the latter is the logarithm function, which is a homomorphism
from the multiplicative group of positive real numbers to the additive group of ~.
The logarithm function is actually a bijective homomorphism and is therefore
a group isomorphism.
If this were a course in algebra, we would show that the division algorithm
and the properties of the degree of a polynomial imply the following theorem.
(However, see Exercises 5.16 through 5.20.)

Theorem 5.4. If PI(t) and P2(t) are relatively prime polynomials, then there
exist polynomials al (t) and a2(t) such that
al (t)PI (t)

+ a2(t)P2(t) =

1.

By relatively prime we mean having no common factors except constants.
We shall assume this theorem and the results of the discussion preceding it in
proving our next theorem.
We say that a subspace MeV is invariant under T E Hom(V) if T[M] eM
[that is, T r M E Hom(M)].
Theorem 5.5. Let T be any transformation in Hom V, and let q be any
polynomial. Then the null space N of q(T) is invariant under T, and if
q = qlq2 is any factorization of q into relatively prime factors and N I and
N 2 are the null space of ql(T) and q2(T), respectively, then N = N I E9 N 2.
Proof. Since T 0 q(T) = q(T) 0 T, we see that if q(T) (a) = 0, then q(T)(Ta) =
T(q(T)(a)) = 0, so T[N] eN. Note also that since q(T) = ql(T) 0 q2(T),
it follows that any a in N 2 is also in N, so N 2 eN. Similarly, N leN. We can
therefore replace V by Nand T by T N j hence we can assume that T E Hom N
and q(T) = ql(T) 0 q2(T) = 0.
Now choose polynomials al and a2 so that alql a2q2 = 1. Since P 1--+ p(T)

r

is an algebraic homomorphism, we then have
al(T)

ql(T)

+ a2(T)

q2(T) = I.

Set Al = al(T), etc., so that Al 0
0 Q2 =
I, QI 0 Q2 = 0, and all the
operators Ai, Qi commute with each other. Finally, set Pi = Ai 0 Qi = Qi 0 Ai
for i = 1,2. Then PI + P 2 = I and P IP 2 = P 2P I = 0. Thus PI and P 2 are
projections, and N is the direct sum of their ranges: N = V I E9 V 2. Since each
range is the null space of the other projectivn, we can rewrite this as N =
N I E9 N 2, where Ni = N(P i ). It remains for us to show that N(P i ) = N(Qi).
Note first that since QI 0 P 2 = QI 0 Q2 0 A2 = 0, we have QI = QI 0 I =
QI 0 (PI + P 2) = QI 0 Pl' Then the two identities Pi = Ai 0 Qi and Qi =
Qi 0 Pi show that the null space of each of Pi and Qi is included in the other, and
so they are equal. This completes the proof of the theorem. 0
Corollary. Let p(t) = rrf'=l Pi(t) be a factorization of the polynomial
p(t) into relatively prime factors, let T be an element of Hom(Il), and set
Ni = N(Pi(T)) for i = 1, ... ,m and N = N(p(T)). Then N and all the
Ni are invariant under T, and N = EBf'=1 N i .
Proof. The proof is by induction on m. The theorem is the case m = 2, and if
we set q = rr~ Pi(t) and M = N(q(T)), then the theorem implies that
N = N I E9 M and that N I and M are invariant under T. Restricting T to M,
we see that the inductive hypothesis implies that M = EBf'=2 Ni and that Ni is
invariant under T for i = 2, ... ,m. The corollary to Lemma 5.3 then yields
our result. 0

*Block decompositions of linear maps. Given T in Hom V and a direct sum
decomposition V = EB7 Vi, with corresponding projections {Pi}7, we can
consider the maps Tij = Pi 0 To Pj. Although Tij is from V to V, we may also
want to consider it as being from V j to Vi (in which case, strictly speaking, what
is it?). We picture the T;/s arranged schematically in a rectangular array
Similar to a matrix, as indicated below for n = 2.

Furthermore, since T = Li,j Tij, we call the doubly indexed family the block
decomposition of T associated with the given direct sum decomposition of V.
1\10re generally, if TEO Hom(V, W) and W also has a direct sum decomposition W = EBi=l Wi, with corresponding projections {Qi}'{', then the family
{Tij} defined by Tij = Qi 0 To P j and pictured as an m X n rectangular array
is the block decomposition of T with respect to the two direct sum decompositions.
Whenever T in Hom V has a special relationship to a particular direct sum
decomposition of V, the corresponding block diagram may have features that
display these special properties in a vivid way; this then helps us to understand
the nature of T better and to calculate with it more easily.

This form is called strictly upper triangular; it is upper triangular and also zero
on the main diagonal. Conversely, if T has some strictly upper-triangular

6. BILINEARITY

Bilinear mappings. The notion of a bilinear mapping is important to the understanding of linear algebra because it is the vector setting for the duality
principle (Section 0.10).
Definition. If U, V, and Ware vector spaces, then a mapping

w:

-<~, 7]> ~ w(~,

7])

from U X V to W is bilinear if it is linear in each variable when the other
variable is held fixed.
That is, if we hold ~ fixed, then 7] ~ w(~, 7]) is linear [and so belongs to
Hom(V, W)]; if we hold 7] fixed, then similarly w(~, 7]) is in Rom(U, W) as a
function of~. This is not the same notion as linearity on the product vector
space U X V. For example, -< x, y > ~ x
y is a linear mapping from 1R2
to IR, but it is not bilinear. If y is held fixed, then the mapping x ~ x
y is
affine (translation through y), but it is not linear unless y is O. On the other
hand, -< x, y > ~ xy is a bilinear mapping from 1R2 to IR, but it is not linear. If y

+

+

68

1.6

VECTOR SPACES

is held fixed, then the mapping x ~ yx is linear. But the sum of two ordered
couples does not map to the sum of their images:
<x, y>

+ <u, v>

+ u, y + v> ~ (x + u)(y + v),
the images, xy + uv. Similarly, the scalar product
=

<x

which is not the sum of
(x, Y) = Ll XiYi is bilinear from IR n X IR n to IR, as we observed in Section 2.
The linear meaning of bilinearity is partially explained in the following
theorem.
Theorem 6.1. If w: U X V ~ W is bilinear, then, by duality, w is equivalent to a linear mapping from U to Hom(V, W) and also to a linear mapping
from V to Hom(U, W).
Proof. For each fixed TJ E V let w~ be the mapping ~ ~ w(~, TJ). That is,
w~w = w(~, TJ).
Then w~ E Hom(U, W) by the bilinear hypothesis. The
mapping TJ ~ w~ is thus from V to Hom(U, W), and its linearity is due to the
linearity of w in TJ when ~ is held fixed:
wCHd!"(O

=

w(~, CTJ

+ cit) =

cw(~, TJ)

+ ciwa, t) =

cw~W

+ ciw!"(~),

so that
Similarly, if we define w~ by w~(TJ) = w(~, TJ), then ~ ~ w~ is a linear mapping
from U to Hom(V, W). Conversely, if IP: U ~ Hom(V, W) is linear, then the
function w defined by w(~, TJ) = IP(O(TJ) is bilinear. Moreover, w~ = IP(~), so
that IP is the mapping ~ ~ w~. 0
We shall see that bilinearity occurs frequently. Sometimes the reinterpretation provided by the above theorem provides new insights; at other times it
seems less helpful.
For example, the composition map <S, T> ~ SoT is bilinear, and the
corollary of Theorem 3.3, which in effect states that composition on the right by
a fixed T is a linear map, is simply part of an explicit statement of the bilinearity.
But the linear map T ~ composition by T is a complicated object that we have
no need for except in the case W = lROn the other hand, the linear combination formula Ll Xi(Xi and Theorem 1.2
do receive new illumination.
Theorem 6.2. The mapping w(x, ex) = Ll Xi(Xi is bilinear from IR n X vn
to V. The mapping ex ~ Wa. is therefore a linear mapping from vn to
Hom(lR n , V), and, in fact, is an isomorphism.
Proof. The linearity of w in x for a fixed ex was proved in Theorem 1.2, and its
linearity in ex for a fixed x is seen in the same way. Then ex ~ Wa. is linear by
Theorem 6.1. Its bijectivity was implicit in Theorem 1.2. 0
It should be remarked that we can use any finite index set I just as well as
the special set'ii and conclude that w(x, ex) = LiEI Xi(Xi is bilinear from IRI X Vi

to V and that a 1-+ Wa. is an isomorphism from VI to Hom(~I, V). Also note
that Wa. = La. in the terminology of Section 1.
Corollary. The scalar product (x, a) = I:1 Xiai is bilinear from ~n X ~n
to ~; therefore, a 1-+ Wa = La is an isomorphism from ~n to Hom(~n, ~).
Natural isomorphisms. We often find two vector spaces related to each other

in such a way that a particular isomorphism between them is singled out. This
phenomenon is hard to pin down in general terms but easy to describe by
examples.
Duality is one source of such "natural" isomorphisms. For example, an
m X n matrix {iii} is a real-valued function of the two variables -< i,} >-, and
as such it is an element of the Cartesian space ~mXn. We can also view {iii} as
a sequence of n column vectors in ~m. This is the dual point of view where we
hold} fixed and obtain a function of i for each i From this point of view {iii}
is an element of (~m)n. This correspondence between ~mXn and (~m)n is clearly
an isomorphism, and is an example of a natural isomorphism.
We review next the various ways of looking at Cartesian n-space itself.
One standard way of defining an ordered n-tuplet is by induction. The ordered
triplet -< x, y, z>- is defined as the ordered pair -< -< x, y>- , z>- , and the ordered
n-tuplet -<XI, ... , xn>- is defined as -< -<XI, ... , Xn-l>-, x n >-. Thus we
define ~n inductively by setting ~l = ~ and ~n = ~n-l X ~.
The ordered n-tuplet can also be defined as the function on n = {I, ... , n}
which assigns Xi to i. Then

= {-<l,Xl>-,"" -<n,xn >-},
and Cartesian n-space is ~n = ~ (1, ... , nl .
-<Xl,""Xn >-

+

Finally, we often wish to view Cartesian (n
m)-space as the Cartesian
product of Cartesian n-space with Cartesian m-space, so we now take
as
as ~n X ~m.
Here again if we pair two different models for the same n-tuplet, we have an
obvious natural isomorphism between the corresponding models for Cartesian
n-space.
Finally, the characteristic properties of Cartesian product spaces given in
Theorems 3.6 and 3.7 yield natural isomorphisms. Theorem 3.6 says that an
n-tuple of linear maps {Tig on a common domain V is equivalent to a single
n-tuple-valued map T, where T(~) = -< Tl(~)"'" TnW >- for all ~ E V.
(This is duality again! TiW is a function of the two variables i and 0 And it is
not hard to see that this identification of T with {Tig is an isomorphism from
I1i Hom(V, Wi) to Hom(V, IIi Wi).
Similarly, Theorem 3.7 identifies an n-tuple of linear maps {T i }1 into a common codomain V with a single linear map T of an n-tuple variable, and this identification is a natural isomorphism from II1 Hom(W i , V) to Hom(II1 Wi, V).

VECTOR SPACES

l.G

An arbitrary isomorphism between two vector spaces identifies them in a
transient way. For the moment we think of the vector spaces as representing the
same abstract space, but only so long as the isomorphism is before us. If we
shift to a different isomorphism between them, we obtain a new temporary
identification. Natural isomorphisms, on the other hand, effect permanent
identifications, and we think of paired objects as being two aspects of the same
object in a deeper sense. Thus we think of a matrix as "being" either a sequence
of row vectors, a sequence of column vectors, or a single function of two integer
indices. We shall take a final look at this question at the end of Section 3 in the
next chapter.
*We can now make the ultimate dissection of the theorems centering
around the linear combination formula. Laws Sl through S3 state exactly that
the scalar product xa is bilinear. l\Iore precisely, they state that the mapping
s: -< x, a >- ~ xa from IR X W to W is bilinear. In the language of Theorem G.1,
xa = w",(x), and from that theorem we conclude that the mapping a ~ w'" is
an isomorphism from W to Hom(lR, W).
This isomorphism between Wand Hom(lR, W) extends to an isomorphism from wn to (Hom(lR, W)) n, which in turn is naturally isomorphic to
Hom(lRn,W) by the second Cartesian product isomorphism. Thus wn is naturally isomorphic to Hom(lR n , W); the mapping is a ~ La., where La.(x) =
L~

Xiai·

In particular, IR n is naturally isomorphic to the space Hom(lR n , IR) of all
linear functionals on IR n , the n-tuple a corresponding to the functional Wa
defined by wa(x) = L~ aiXi.
Also, (IRrn)n is naturally isomorphic to Hom(lR n , 1R1n). And since IRmXn is
naturally isomorphic to (IRrn)n, it follows that the spaces IRmXn and Hom(lR n , IRrn)
are naturally isomorphic. This is simply our natural association of a transformation Tin Hom(lR n , IRm) to an m X n matrix {tij}.

CHAPTER 2

FINITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

We have defined a vector space to be finite-dimensional if it has a finite spanning
set. In this chapter we shall focus our attention on such spaces, although this
restriction is unnecessary for some of our discussion. We shall see that we can
assign to each finite-dimensional space V a unique integer, called the dimension
of V, which satisfies our intuitive requirements about dimensionality and which
becomes a principal tool in the deeper explorations into the nature of such
e;paces. A number of "dimensional identities" are crucial in these further
investigations. We shall find that the dual space of all linear functionals on V,
V* = Hom(V, IR), plays a more satisfactory role in finite-dimensional theory
than in the context of general vector spaces. (However, we shall see later in
the book that when we add limit theory to our algebra, there are certain special
infinite-dimensional vector spaces for which the dual space plays an equally
important role.) A finite-dimensional space can be characterized as a vector
space isomorphic to some Cartesian space IR n , and such an isomorphism allows a
transformation T in Hom V to be "transferred" to IR n , whereupon it acquires a
matrix. The theory of linear transformations on such spaces is therefore mirrored
eompletely by the theory of matrices. In this chapter we shall push much
deeper into the nature of this relationship than we did in Chapter 1. We also
include a section on matrix computations, a brief section describing the trace
and determinant functions, and a short discussion of the diagonalization of a
quadratic form.
I. BASES

Consider again a fixed finite indexed set of vectors a = {ai: i E I} in V and the
corresponding linear combination map La.: x f---+ L Xiai from IRI to V having a
lie; skeleton.
Definition. The finite indexed set {ai: i E I} is independent if the above
mapping La. is injective, and {ai} is a basis for V if La. is an isomorphism
(onto V). In this situation we call {ai: i E J} an ordered basis or frame if
J = n = {I, ... , n} for some positive integer n.

Thus {ai : i E J} is a basis if and only if for each ~ E V there exists a unique
illdexed "coefficient" set x = {Xi: i E I} E IRI such that ~ = L Xiai. The
71

72

numbers Xi always exist because {ai: i E I} spans V, and x is unique because
La. is injective.
For example, we can check directly that hI = -< 2, 1>- and h 2 = -< 1, -3 >form a basis for jR2. The problem is to show that for each y E jR2 there is a
unique x such that

I

Since this vector equation is equivalent to the two scalar equations YI =
2XI + X2 and Y2 = Xl - 3X2, we can find the unique solution Xl = (3YI + Y2)/7,
X2 = (YI - 2Y2)/7 by the usual elimination method of secondary school
algebra.
The form of these definitions is dictated by our interpretation of the linear
combination formula as a linear mapping. The more usual definition of independence is a corollary.
The independence of the finite indexed set {ai: i E I} is
equivalent to the property that LI Xiai = 0 only if all the coefficients Xi
are O.
Lelllllla I.I.

Proof. This is the property that the null space of La. consist only of 0, and is
thus equivalent to the injectivity of La., that is, to the independence of {ai} , by
Lemma 1.1 of Chapter 1. 0
If {ain is an ordered basis (frame) for V, the unique n-tuple x such that
L~ Xiai is called the coordinate n-tuple of ~ (with respect to the basis {ai}),
and Xi is the ith coordinate of~. We call Xiai (and sometimes Xi) the ith component
of~. The mapping La. will be called a basis isomorphism, and its inverse L;:l,
which assigns to each vector ~ E V its unique coordinate n-tuple x, is a coordinate
isomorphism. The linear functional ~ 1---+ Xi is the jth coordinate functional;
~

=

it is the composition of the coordinate isomorphism ~ 1---+ x with the jth coordinate projection x 1---+ Xi on jRn. We shall see in Section 3 that the n coordinate
functionals form a basis for V* = Hom(V, jR).
In the above paragraph we took the index set I to be n = {I, ... , n} and
used the language of n-tuples. The only difference for an arbitrary finite index
set is that we speak of a coordinate function x = {Xi: i E I} instead of a coordinate n-tuple.
Our first concern will be to show that every finite-dimensional (finitely
spanned) vector space has a basis. We start with some remarks about indices.
We note first that a finite indexed set {ai: i E I} can be independent only
if the indexing is injective as a mapping into V, for if ak = aI, then L Xiai = 0,
where Xk = 1, Xl = -1, and Xi = 0 for the remaining indices. Also, if {ai : i E l}
is independent and J C I, then {ai : i E J} is independent, since if LJ Xiai = 0,
and if we set Xi = 0 for i E I - J, then LI Xiai = 0, and so each xi is o.
A finite unindexed set is said to be independent if it is independent in some

2.1

BASES

73

(necessarily bijective) indexing. It will of course then be independent with
respect to any bijective indexing. An arbitrary set is independent if every finite
subset is independent. It follows that a set A is dependent (not independent) if
and only if there exist distinct clements al> ..• , an in A and scalars Xl, . . . , xn
not all zero such that L7 x,;a,; = o. An unindexed basis would be defined in the
obvious way. However, a set can always be regarded as being indexed, by itself
if necessary!
Lemma 1.2. If B is an independent subset of a vector space V and {3 is any
vector not in the linear span L(B), then B U {{3} is independent.

Proof. Otherwise there is a zero linear combination, ;r{3 + L~ :r,;{3,- = 0, where
•.. , {3n arc distinct clements of B and the coefficients are not all O. But then
X cannot be zero: if it were, the equation would contradict the independence of
B. We can therefore divide by;'/: and solve for {3, so that {3 E L(B), a contradiction. 0

{3 I>

The reader will remember that we call a vector space V finite-dimensional
if it has a finite spanning set {aJ 7. We can use the above lemma to construct a
basis for such a V by choosing some of the a/so We simply run through the
sequence {aig and choose those members that increase the linear span of the
preceding choices. We end up with a spanning set since {aig spans, and our
subsequence is independent at each step, by the lemma. In the same way we
can extend an independent set {{3i} 7 to a basis by choosing some members of a
spanning set {ai} 7. This procedure is intuitive, but it is messy to set up rigorously. We shall therefore proceed differently.
Theorem 1.1. Any minimal finite spanning set is a basis, and therefore any
finite-dimensional vector space V has a basis. More generally, if {{3j : j E J}
is a finite independent set and {ai: i E J} is a finite spanning set, and if K
is a smallest subset of J such that {{3j} J U {ai} K spans, then this collection is
independent and 2, basis. Therefore, any finite independent subset of a
finite-dimensional space can be extended to a basis.

Proof. It is sufficient to prove the second assertion, since it includes the first
as a special case. If {{3j} J U {ai} K is not independent, then there is a nontrivial
zero linear combination LJ Yj{3j
LK Xiai = O. If every Xi were zero, this
pquation would contradict the independence of {{3j} J. Therefore, some Xk is
Ilot zero, and we can solve the equation for ak. That is, if we set L = K - {k},
then the linear span of {{3j} J U {ai} L contains ak. It therefore includes the whole
original spanning set and hence is V. But this contradicts the minimal nature of
K, since L is a proper subset of K. Consequently, {{3j} J U {aJ K is independent. 0

We next note that

~n

itself has a very special basis. In the indexing map

,: ~ ai the vector aj corresponds to the index j, but under the linear combiIlation map x ~ L Xiai the vector aj corresponds to the function oj which has
t he value 1 at j and the value 0 elsewhere, so that Li o{ai = aj. This function

74

2.1

FINITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

~j is called a Kronecker delta function. It is clearly the characteristic function XB
of the one-point set B = {J}, and the symbol ,~j, is ambiguous, just as 'XB'
is ambiguous; in each case the meaning depends on what domain is implicit from
the context. We have already used the delta functions on ~n in proving Theorem
1.2 of Chapter 1.

Theorem 1.2. The Kronecker functions {~j}i=l form a basis for ~n.

Proof. Since Li Xi~i(j) = Xj by the definition of ~i, we see that L~ Xi~i is
the n-tuple x itself, so the linear combination mapping L5: x 1--+ L~ Xi~i is the
identity mapping x 1--+ x, a trivial isomorphism. 0

Among all possible indexed bases for ~n, the Kronecker basis is thus singled
out by the fact that its basis isomorphism is the identity; for this reason it is
called the standard basis or the natural basis for ~n. The same holds for ~l for
any finite set I.
Finally, we shall draw some elementary conclusions from the existence of
a basis.
Theorem 1.3. If T E Hom(V, W) is an isomorphism and a =
is a basis for V, then {T(ai) : i E I} is a basis for W.

{ai: i E I}

Proof. By hypothesis Lo. is an isomorphism in Hom(~n, V), and so To Lo. is
an isomorphism in Hom(~n, W). Its skeleton {T(ai)} is therefore a basis for W. 0

We can view any basis {ai} as the image of the standard basis {~i} under
the basis isomorphism. Conversely, any isomorphism 8: ~l --t B becomes a basis
isomorphism for the basis aj = 8(~j).
Theorem 1.4. If X and Yare complementary subspaces of a vector space V,

then the union of a basis for X and a basis for Y is a basis for V. Conversely,
if a basis for V is partitioned into two sets, with linear spans X and Y,
respectively, then X and Yare complementary subspaces of V ..
Proof. We prove only the first statement. If {ai : i E J} is a basis for X and
{ai: i E K} is a basis for Y, then it is clear that {ai : i E J uK} spans V, since
its span includes both X and Y, and so X
Y = V. Suppose then that
LJUK Xiai = O. Setting ~ = LJ Xiai and 7J = LK Xiai, we see that ~ E X,
7J E Y, and ~
7J = O. But then ~ = 7J = 0, since X and Yare complementary.
And then Xi = 0 for i E J because {ai} J is independent, and Xi = 0 for i E K
because {ai} K is independent. Therefore, {ai} JUK is a basis for V. We leave the
converse argument as an exercise. 0

If we follow a coordinate isomorphism by a linear combination map, we get
the mapping of the following existence theorem, which we state only in n-tuple
form.

1.5. If {3 = {l1i} ~ is an ordered basis for the vector space V, and
if {ai} ~ is any n-tuple of vectors in a vector space W, then there exists a
unique S E Hom(V, W) such that S(l1i) = ai for i = 1, ... , n.
Theorelll

Proof. By hypothesis L~ is an isomorphism in Hom(!R n , V), and so
S = La. 0 (L~)-1 is an clement of Hom(V, W) such that S(l1i) = La.(oi) = ai.
Conversely, if S E Hom(V, W) is such that S(l1i) = ai for all i, then S 0 L~( oi) =
ai for all i, so that S 0 L~ = La.. Thus S is uniquely determined as La. 0 (L~) -1. 0
It is natural to ask how the unique S above varies with the n-tuple {ai}.
The answer is: linearly and "isomorphically".
Theorelll

1.6. Let {l1i} ~ be a fixed ordered basis for the vector space

V, and for each n-tuple a = {aig chosen from the vector space W let
Sa. E Hom(V, W) be the unique transformation defined above. Then the
map a ~ Sa. is an isomorphism from
to Hom(V, W).

wn

Proof. As above, Sa. = La. 0 (r\ where 0 is the basis isomorphism L~. N"ow we
know from Theorem 6.2 of Chapter 1 that a ~ La. is an isomorphism from wn
to Hom(!R n , W), and composition on the right by the fixed coordinate isomorphism 0- 1 is an isomorphism from Hom(!R n , W) to Hom(V, W) by the corollary
to Theorem 3.3 of Chapter 1. Composing these two isomorphisms gives us the
theorem. 0
*Infinite bases. Most vector spaces do not have finite bases, and it is natural to
try to extend the above discussion to index sets I that may be infinite. The
Kronecker functions {oi : i E I} have the same definitions, but they no longer
span !R I . By definition f is a linear combination of the functions oi if and only
if f is of the form LiEI! Cioi, where II is a finite subset of I. But then f = 0
outside of I l' Conversely, if f E !R I is 0 except on a finite set 111 then f =
LiEI J( i) oi. The linear span of {oi : i E I} is thus exactly the set of all functions of !R I that are zero except on a finite set. We shall designate this subspace !RI.
If {ai: i E I} is an indexed set of vectors in V and f E !R I , then the sum
LiEI f(i)ai becomes meaningful if we adopt the reasonable convention that the
sum of an arbitrary number of O's is O. Then LiEI = LiEIo' where lois any
finite subset of I outside of which f is zero.
With this convention, La.:f ~ Ld(i)ai is a linear map from !RI to V, as in
Theorem 1.2 of Chapter 1. And with the same convention, LiEI f(i)ai is an
elegant expression for the general linear combination of the vectors ai. Instead
of choosing a finite subset II and numbers Ci for just those indices i in II, we
define Ci for all i E I, but with the stipulation that Ci = 0 for all but a finite
number of indices. That is, we take c = {Ci: i E I} as a function in !RI.

76

FINITE-DlMENSro","AL VECTOR SPACES

2.1

We make the same definitions of independence and basis as before. Then
{ai: i E l} is a basis for V if and only if La.: IRI ~ V is an isomorphism, i.e., if
and only if for each ~ E V there exists a unique x E IRI such that ~ = Li Xiai.

By using an axiom of set theory called the axiom of choice, it can be shown
that every vector space has a basis in this sense and that any independent set
can be extended to a basis. Then Theorems 1.4 and 1.5 hold with only minor
changes in notation. In particular, if a basis for a subspace 111 of V is extended
to a basis for V, then the linear span of the added part is a subspace N complementary to M. Thus, in a purely algebraic sense, every subspace has complementary subspaces. We assume this fact in some of our exercises.
The above sums are always finite (despite appearances), and the above
notion of basis is purely algebraic. However, infinite bases in this sense are not
very useful in analysis, and we shall therefore concentrate for the present on
spaces that have finite bases (i.e., are finite-dimensional). Then in one important context later on we shall discuss infinite bases where the sums are genuinely
infinite by virtue of limit theory.

2. DIMENSION

The concept of dimension rests on the fact that two different bases for the same
space always contain the same number of elements. This number, which is
then the number of elements in every basis for V, is called the dimension of V.
It tells all there is to know about V to within isomorphism: There exists an
isomorphism between two spaces if and only if they have the same dimension.
We shall consider only finite dimensions. If V is not finite-dimensional, its
dimension is an infinite cardinal number, a concept with which the reader is
probably unfamiliar.
Lemma 2.1. If V is finite-dimensional and T in Hom V is surjective, then T
is an isomorphism.

Proof. Let 11 be the smallest number of elements that can span V. That is, there
is some spanning set {a;} 7 and none with fewer than n elements. Then {ai} 7 is a
basis, by Theorem 1.1, and the linear combination map 0: x f---> 2::7 Xiai is
accordingly a basis isomorphism. But {iJJ 7 = {T(ai)} 7 also spans, since T is
surjective, and so ToO is also a basis isomorphism, for the same reason. Then
T = (T 0 0) 0 0- 1 is an isomorphism. 0
Theorem 2.1. If V is finite-dimensional, then all bases for V contain the
same number of elements.

Proof. Two bases with nand m elements determine basis isomorphisms
0: IR n ~ V and cp: 1R1n ~ V. Suppose that m < n and, viewing IR n as IR rn X IR n - m ,

78
let

2.2

FINITE-DIMEXSIONAL VECTOR SPACES
7r

be the projection of IR n onto IR m,

Since T = 0- 1 0 cp is an isomorphism from IRm to IR n and To 7r: IR n ~ IR n is
therefore surjective, it follows from the lemma that T 0 7r is an isomorphism.
Then 7r = T- l 0 (T 0 7r) is an isomorphism. But it isn't, because 7r(on) = 0,
and we have a contradiction. Therefore no basis can be smaller than any other
basis. D
The integer that is the number of elements in every basis for V is of course
called the dimension of V, and we designate it d(V). Since the standard basis
{oi} ~ for IR n has n elements, we see that IR n is n-dimensional in this precise sense.
Corollary. Two finite-dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic if and only

if they have the same dimension.
Proof. If T is an isomorphism from V to Wand B is a basis for V, then T[B] is a
basis for W by Theorem 1.3. Therefore d(V) = #B = #T[B] = d(W), where
#A is the number of elements in A. Conversely, if d(V) = d(W) = n, then V
and Ware each isomorphic to IR n and so to each other. D
Theorem 2.2. Every subspace M of a finite-dimensional vector space V is

finite-dimensional.
Proof. Let a be the family of finite independent subsets of M. By Theorem 1.1,
if A E a, then A can be extended to a basis for V, and so #A ~ d(V). Thus
{#A : A E a} is a finite set of integers, and we can choose B E a such that
n = #B is the maximum of this finite set. But then L(B) = M, because otherwise for any a E ]J[ - L(B) we have B U {a} E a, by Lemma 1.2, and
#(B U {a}) = n

+ 1,

contradicting the maximal nature of n. Thus M is finitely spanned. D
Corollary. Every subspace ]J[ of a finite-dimensional space V has a comple-

ment.
Proof. Use Theorem 1.1 to extend a basis for M to a basis for V, and let N be
the linear span of the added vectors. Then apply Theorem 1.4. D

We now prove two basic dimensional identities.
We will always assume V finite-dimensional.
DiInensional identities.

d(V 2)' More generally, if V = EB~ Vi then d(V) = L~ d(Vi)'

3. THE DUAL SPACE

Although throughout this section all spaces will be assumed finite-dimensional,
many of the definitions and properties are valid for infinite-dimensional spaces
as well. But for such spaces there is a difference between pmely algebraic
situations and situations in which algebra is mixed with hypotheses of continuity.
One of the blessings of finite dimensionality is the absence of this complication.
As the reader has probably surmised from the number of special linear functionals
we have met, particularly the coordinate functionals, the space Hom(V, IR)
of all linear functionals on V plays a special role.

82

2.3

FINITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

Definition. The dual space (or conjugate space) V* of the vector space V is

the vector space Hom(V, IR) of all linear mappings from V to IR. Its elements
are called linear functionals.
Weare going to see that in a certain sense V is in turn the dual space of
V* (V and (V*)* are naturally isomorphic), so that the two spaces are symmetrically related. We shall briefly study the notion of annihilation (orthogonality) which has its origins in this setting, and then see that there is a natural
isomorphism between Hom(V, W) and Hom(W*, V*). This gives the mathematician a new tool to use in studying a linear transformation Tin Hom(V, W);
the relationship between T and its image T* exposes new properties of T itself.
Dual bases. At the outset one naturally wonders how big a space V* is, and we
settle the question immediately.
Theorem 3.1. Let {f3i}~ be an ordered basis for V, and let ej be the corre-

sponding jth coordinate functional on V: ej(l;) = Xi> where
Then {ejg is an ordered basis for V*.

~

=

Proof. Let us first make the proof by a direct elementary calculation.

L~

°

for
a) Independence. Suppose that L~ Cjej = 0, that is, L~ Cjej(O =
all ~ E V. Taking ~ = f3i and remembering that the coordinate n-tuple of f3i
is ~i, we see that the above equation reduces to Ci = 0, and this for all i. Therefore, {ej}~ is independent.
b) Spanning. First note that the basis expansion ~ = L Xif3i can be rewritten ~ = L ei(~)f3i' Then for any A E V* we have A(~) = L~ liei(~)'
where we have set li = A(f3i). That is, A = L liei. This shows that {ej} ~ spans
V*, and, together with (a), that it is a basis. D
Definition. The basis {ej} for V* is called the dual of the basis {f3i} for V.

As usual, one of our fundamental isomorphisms is lurking behind all this,
but we shall leave its exposure to an exercise.
Corollary. d(V*)

The three equations

ei(~)

are worth looking at. The first two are symmetrically related, each presenting
the basis expansion of a vector with its coefficients computed by applying the
corresponding element of the dual basis to the vector. The third is symmetric
itself between ~ and A.
Since a finite-dimensional space V and its dual space V* have the same
dimension, they are of course isomorphic. In fact, each basis for V defines an
isomorphism, for we have the associated coordinate isomorphism from V to IR n ,
the dual basis isomorphism from IR n to V*, and therefore the composite isomor-

2.3

THE DUAL SPACE

83

phism from V to V*. This isomorphism varies with the basis, however, and there
is in general no natural isomorphism between V and V*.
It is another matter with Cartesian space IR n because it has a standard
basis, and therefore a standard isomorphism with its dual space (IRn)*. It is
not hard to see that this is the isomorphism a 1-+ La, where La(x) = L~ aiXi,
that we discussed in Section 1.6. We can therefore feel free to identify IR n with
(IRn)*, only keeping in mind that when we think of an n-tuple a as a linear
functional, we mean the functional La(x) = L~ aiXi.
The second conjugate space. Despite the fact that V and V* are not naturally

isomorphic in general, we shall now see that V is naturally isomorphic to V** =
(V*)*.
TheorelD 3.2. The function w: V X V* ~ IR defined by w(~, f) = f(O is

bilinear, and the mapping ~

1-+

w~

from V to V** is a natural isomorphism.

Proof. In this context we generally set ~** = w~, so that ~** is defined by
~**(f) = fW for all f E V*. The bilinearity of w should be clear, and Theorem
6.1 of Chapter 1 therefore applies. The reader might like to run through a
direct check of the linearity of ~ 1-+ ~** starting with (Cl h
C2 ~2) **(1).
There still is the question of the injectivity of this mapping. If a ~ 0, we
can find f E V* so that f(a) ~ O. One way is to make a the first vector of an
ordered basis and to takefas the first functional in the dual basis; thenf(a) = 1.
Since a**(f) = f(a) ~ 0, we see in particular that a** ~ O. The mapping
~ ~ ~** is thus injective, and it is then bijective by the corollary of Theorem
2.4. 0

+

If we think of V** as being naturally identified with V in this way, the two
Hpaces V and V* are symmetrically related to each other. Each is the dual of
t.he other. In the expression 'f(~)' we think of both symbols as variables and
t.hen hold one or the other fixed for the two interpretations. In such a situation
we often use a more symmetric symbolism, such as (~,f), to indicate our intent.ion to treat both symbols as variables.

{Xi} is the basis in V* dual to the basis {ai} in V, then
{ai*} is the basis in V** dual to the basis {Xi} in V*.

LelDlDa 3.1. If

1'l'oof. We have ai*(Xj) = Xj(ai) = 5}, which shows that a{* is the ith coordinate projection. In case the reader has forgotten, the basis expansion f = L CjXj
implies that ai*(f) = f(ai) = (L CjXj) (ai) = Ci, so that ai* is the mapping
J 1-+ Ci. 0
Annihilator subspaces. It is in this dual situation that orthogonality first
naturally appears. However, we shall save the term 'orthogonal' for the latter
enntext in which V and V* have been identified through a scalar product, and
shall speak here of the annihilator of a set rather than its orthogonal complement.

Lj'=l CjAj be its (dual) basis expansion. Then for each i ::; m we have Ci =

The adjoint of T. We shall now see that with every T in Hom(V, W) there is
naturally associated an element of Hom(W*, V*) which we call the adjoint of
T and designate T*. One consequence of the intimate relationship between T
and T* is that the range of T* is exactly the annihilator of the null space of

T. Combined with our dimensional identities, this implies that the ranges of T
and T* have the same dimension. And later on, after we have established the
connection between matrix representations of T and T*, this turns into the very
mysterious fact that the dimension of the linear span of the row vectors of an mby-n matrix is the same as the dimension of the linear span of its column vectors,
which gives us our notion of the rank of a matrix. In Chapter 5 we shall study a
situation (Hilbert space) in which we are given a fixed fundamental isomorphism
between V and V*. If T is in Hom V, then of course T* is in Hom V*, and we
can use this isomorphism to "transfer" T* into Hom V. But now T can be com-

pared with its (transferred) adjoint T*, and they may be equal. That is, T may
be self-adjoint. It turns out that the self-adjoint transformations are "nice" ones,
as we shall see for ourselves in simple cases, and also, fortunately, that many
important linear maps arising from theoretical physics are self-adjoint.
If T E Hom(V, W) and l E W*, then of course loT E V*. Moreover, the
mapping l ~ loT (T fixed) is a linear mapping from W* to V* by the corollary
to Theorem 3.3 of Chapter 1. This mapping is called the adjoint of T and is
designated T*. Thus T* E Hom(W*, V*) and T*(l) = loT for all l E W*.
Theorelll 3.4. The mapping T ~ T* is an isomorphism from the vector

space Hom(V, W) to the vector space Hom(W*, V*). Also (T ° S)* =
S* ° T* under the relevant hypotheses on domains and codomains.
Proof. Everything we have said above through the linearity of T ~ T* is a
consequence of the bilinearity of w(l, T) = loT. The map we have called T*
is simply WT, and the linearity of T ~ T* thus follows from Theorem 6.1 of
Chapter 1. Again the reader might benefit from a direct linearity check, beginc2T2)*(l).
ning with (ciTI
To see that T ~ T* is injective, we take any T .,t. 0 and choose a E V so
that T(a) .,t. O. We then choose l E W* so that l(T(a») .,t. o. Since l(T(a») =
(T*(l») (a), we have verified that T* .,t. o.
Next, if d(V) = m and d(W) = n, then also d(V*) = m and d(W*) = n .
bythecorollaryofTheorem3.1,andd(Hom(V, W») = mn= d(Hom(W*, V*»)

corollary of Theorem 2.4).
Finally, (T ° S)*l = lo (T ° S) = (loT) ° S = S*(l ° T) = S*(T*(l») =
(S* ° T*)l, so that (T ° S)* = S* ° T*. D

The reader would probably guess that T** becomes identified with T under
the identification of V with V**. This is so, and it is actually the reason for
calling the isomorphism ~ ~ ~** natural. We shall return to this question at the
end of the section. Meanwhile, we record an important elementary identity.
Theorelll 3.5.

Proof. The following statements are definitionally equivalent in pairs as they
occur: l E N(T*), T*(l) = 0, loT = 0, l(T(~») = 0 for all ~ E V, l E (R(T»)o.
Therefore, N(T*) = (R(T»)o. The other proof is similar and will be left to the
reader. [Start with a E N(T) and end with a E (R(T*»)o.] D

The rank of a linear transformation is the dimension of its range space.
Corollary. The rank of T* is equal to the rank of T.

Proof. The dimensions of R(T) and (N(T»)O are each d(V) - d(N(T») by
Theorems 2.4 and 3.3, and the second is d(R(T*») by the above theorem.
Therefore, d(R(T») = d(R(T*»). D

*Natural isomorphisms again. We are now in a position to illustrate more
precisely the notion of a natural isomorphism. We saw above that among all the
isomorphisms from a finite-dimensional vector space V to its second dual, we
could single one out naturally, namely, the map ~ ~ ~**, where ~**(f) = f(~)
for all f in V*. Let us call this isomorphism cpv. The technical meaning of the
word 'natural' pertains to the collection {cpv} of all these isomorphisms; we
found a way to choose one isomorphism CPV for each space V, and the proof that
this is a "natural" choice lies in the smooth way the various cpv's relate to each
other. To see what we mean by this, consider two finite-dimensional spaces V
and Wand a map Tin Hom(V, W). Then T* is in Hom(W*, V*) and T** =
(T*)* is in Hom(V**, W**). The setting for the four maps T, T**, cpv, and CPW
can be displayed in a diagram as follows:
V _ _----.::T'--___ W

'I'~j

j'l'w

T**
V * * - - - - - - - W**

The diagram indicates two maps, CPw 0 T and T** 0 cpv, from V to W**, and we
define the collection of isomorphisms {cpv} to be natural if these two maps are
always equal for any V, Wand T. This is the condition that the two ways of
going around the diagram give the same result, i.e., that the diagram be commutative.
Put another way, it is the condition that T "become" T** when V is identified with V** (by cpv) and W is identified with W** (by cpw). We leave its proof
as an exercise.

By popular conception a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers such as

Note that the first index numbers the rows and the second index numbers the
columns. If there are m rows and n columns in the array, it is called an m-by-n
(m X n) matrix. This notion is inexact. A rectangular array is a way of picturing
a matrix, but a matrix is really a function, just as a sequence is a function. With
the notation m = {I, ... , m}, the above matrix is a function assigning a number to every pair of integers -< i, j>- in m X n. It is thus an element of the set
IR,mXn. The addition of two m X n matrices is performed in the obvious placeby-place way, and is merely the addition of two functions in IR,mX7i; the same is
true for scalar multiplication. The set of all m X n matrices is thus the vector
space IR,mXn, a Cartesian space with a rather fancy finite index set. We shall use
the customary index notation tij for the value t(i, j) of the function t at -< i, j>-,
and we shall also write {tij} for t, just as we do for sequences and other indexed
collections.
The additional properties of matrices stem from the correspondence between
m X n matrices {tij} and transformations T E Hom(lR,n, IR,m).
The following theorem restates results from the first chapter. See Theorems
1.2, 1.3, and 6.2 of Chapter 1 and the discussion of the linear combination map
at the end of Section 1.6.

Theorem 4.1. Let {tij} be an m-by-n matrix, and let t

such that skeleton T = {tj} , i.e., such that T( oj) = t j for all j. T is defined
as the linear combination mapping x ~ y = 2:.1=1 Xjt j, and an equivalent

The only additional remark called for here is that in identifying an m X n
matrix with an n-tuple of m-tuples, we are making use of one of the standard
identifications of duality (Section 0.10). We are treating the natural isomorphism
between the really distinct spaces ~mXn and (~m)n as though it were the identity.
We can also relate T to {tij} by way of the rows of {tij}. As above, taking
ith coordinates in the m-tuple equation y = 2:.1=1 Xjt j, we get the equivalent
and familiar system of numerical (scalar) equations Yi = 2: 1=1 tijXj for
i = 1, ... ,m. Now the mapping x ~ 2:1=1 CjXj from ~n to ~ is the most general linear functional on ~n. In the above numerical equations, therefore, we
have simply used the m rows of the matrix {tij} to present the m-tuple of linear
functionals on ~n which is equivalent to the single m-tuple-valued linear
mapping T in Hom(~n, ~m) by Theorem 3.6 of Chapter 1.
The choice of ordered bases for arbitrary finite-dimensional spaces V and W
allows us to transfer the above theorem to Hom(V, W). Since we are now going
to correlate a matrix t in ~mXn with a transformation Tin Hom(V, W), we shall
designate the transformation in Hom(~n, ~m) discussed above by T.
Theorem 4.2. Let {ajg and {Ili} 7 be ordered bases for the vector spaces V
and W, respectively. For each matrix {tij} in ~mXn let T be the unique

element of Hom(V, W) such that T(aj) = 2:7'=1 tiif3i for j = 1, ... , n.
Then the mapping {tij} ~ T is an isomorphism from ~mXn to Hom(V, W).
1'1'oof. We simply combine the isomorphism {tij} ~ T of the above theorem
with the isomorphism T ~ T = 1/; 0 To cp-1 from Hom(~n, ~m) to Hom(V, W),
where cp and 1/; are the two given basis isomorphisms. Then T is the transformation described in the theorem, for T(aj) = 1/;(T(cp-1(aj»)) = 1/;(T(oj») =
f(t;) = 2:7'=1 tijlli' The map {tij} ~ T is the composition of two isomorphisms
alld so is an isomorphism. 0

It is instructive to look at what we have just done in a slightly different way.
(:iven the matrix {tij}, let Tj be the vector in W whose coordinate m-tuple is the
.It h column t j of the matrix, so that T j = 2:~ 1tijlli. Then let T be the unique
(·lement of Hom(V, W) such that T(aj) = Tj for j = 1, ... ,n. Now we have
()btained T from {tij} in the following two steps: T corresponds to the n-tuple

and {T j} ~ corresponds to the matrix {tij} by extension of the coordinate isomorphism between W and ~m to its product isomorphism from wn to (~m)n.

Proof. We know that the scalar equations are equivalent to y = T(x), which is
the equation y = ",,-1 0 To <p(x). The isomorphism"" converts this to the
equation." = T(~). 0
Our problem now is to discover the matrix analogues of relationship between
linear transformations. For transformations between the Cartesian spaces ~n
this is a fairly direct, uncomplicated business, because, as we know, the matrix
here is a natural alter ego for the transformation. But when we leave the Cartesian spaces, a transformation T no longer has a matrix in any natural way, and
only acquires one when bases are chosen and a corresponding T on Cartesian
spaces is thereby obtained. All matrices now are determined with respect to
chosen bases, and all calculations are complicated by the necessary presence of
the basis and coordinate isomorphisms. There are two ways of handling this
situation. The first, which we shall follow in general, is to describe things
directly for the general space V and simply to accept the necessarily more complicated statements involving bases and dual bases and the corresponding loss in
transparency. The other possibility is first to read off the answers for the
Cartesian spaces and then to transcribe them via coordinate isomorphisms.
Lemma 4.1. The matrix element tkj can be obtained from T by the formula

where fJ.k is the kth element of the dual basis in W*.
Proof. fJ.k(T(aj))

= fJ.k(Li"=1 tij{Ji) = Li tijfJ.k(fJ;) = Li tij

c5~

= tkj. 0

In terms of Cartesian spaces, T(c5 j ). is the jth column m-tuple t j in the
matrix {tij} of T, and tkj is the kth coordinate of tj. From the point of view of
linear maps, the kth coordinate is obtained by applying the kth coordinate
projection 'Irk, so that tkj = 'lrk(T(c5 j)). Under the basis isomorphisms, 'Irk
becomes fJ.k, T becomes T, c5 j becomes aj, and the Cartesian identity becomes
the identity of the lemma.

Definition. The row space of the matrix {tii} E ~mXn is the subspace of ~n
spanned by the m row vectors. The column space is similarly the span of
the n column vectors in ~m.
Corollary. The row and column spaces of a matrix have the same dimension.

Proof. If T is the element of Hom(~n, ~m) defined by T(~i) = ti, then the
set {tin of column vectors in the matrix {tii} is the image under T of the standard basis of ~n, and so its span, which we have called the column space of the
matrix, is exactly the range of T. In particular, the dimension of the column
space is d(R(T)) = rank T.
Since the matrix of T* is the transpose t* of the matrix t, we have, similarly,
t.hat rank T* is the dimension of the column space of t*. But the column space
of t* is the row space of t, and the assertion of the corollary is thus reduced to
the identity rank T* = rank T, which is the corollary of Theorem 3.5. 0
This common dimension is called the rank of the matrix.
Matrix products. If T E Hom(~n, ~m) and 8 E Hom(~m, ~l), then of course
R = 80 T E Hom(~n, ~l), and it certainly should be possible to calculate the

matrix r of R from the matrices sand t of 8 and T, respectively. To make this
eomputation, we set y = T(x) and z = 8(y), so that z = (8 0 T)(x) = R(x).
The equivalent scalar equations in terms of the matrices t and s are

We thus have found the formula for the matrix r of the map R = 80 T: x - t z.
Of course, r is defined to be the product of the matrices sand t, and we write
r = s . t or r = st.
Note that in order for the product st to be defined, the number of columns
ill the left factor must equal the number of rows in the right factor. We get the
clement rki by going across the kth row of s and simultaneously down the jth

resulting products. This process is illustrated in Fig. 2.1. In terms of the scalar
product (x, y) = L~ XiYi on ~n, we see that the element Tkj in r = st is the
scalar product of the kth row of s and the jth column of t.

Since we have defined the product of two matrices as the matrix of the
product of the corresponding transformations, i.e., so that the mapping T ~ {tij}
preserves products (8 0 T ~ st), it follows from the general principle of
Theorem 4.1 of Chapter 1 that the algebraic laws satisfied by composition of
transformations will automatically hold for the product of matrices. For
example, we know without making an explicit computation that matrix multiplication is associative. Then for square matrices we have the following theorem.
Theorem 4.4. The set M n of square n X n matrices is an algebra naturally

isomorphic to the algebra

Hom(~n).

Proof, We already know that T ~ {tij} is a natu~al linear isomorphism from
Hom(~n) to l\f n (Theorem 4.1), and we have defined the product of matrices
so that the mapping also preserves multiplication. The laws of algebra (for an
algebra) therefore follow for M n from our observation in Theorem 3.5 of Chapter
1 that they hold for Hom(~n). 0

The identity I in Hom(~n) takes the basis vector oj into itself, and therefore
its matrix e has oj for its jth column: e j = oj. Thus eij = o{ = 1 if i = j
and eij = o{ = 0 if i ~ f. That is, the matrix e is 1 along the main diagonal
(from upper left to lower right) and 0 elsewhere. Since I ~ e under the algebra
isomorphism T ~ t, we know that e is the identity for matrix multiplication.
Of course, we can check this directly: LJ=l tijejk = tik, and similarly for multiplying by e on the left. The symbol 'e' is ambiguous in that we have used it
to denote the identity in the space ~nXn of square n X n matrices for any n.
Corollary. A square n X n matrix t has a multiplicative inverse if and only
if its rank is n.

2.4

Proof. By the theorem there exists an 8 E M n such that 8t = t8 = e if and
only if there exists an 8 E Hom(lR n ) such that 8 0 T = T 0 8 = I. But such
an 8 exists if and only if T is an isomorphism, and by the corollary to Theorem 2.4
this is equivalent to the dimension of the range of T being n. But this dimension
is the rank of t, and the argument is complete. D

A square matrix (or a transformation in Hom V) is said to be nonsingular
if it is invertible.
Theorem 4.5. If {ai}~' {j3j}i', and {'Yk}11 are ordered bases for the vector spaces U, V, and lV, respectively, and if T E Hom(U, V) and
8 E Hom(V, lV), then the matrix of 80 T is the product of the matrices

of 8 and T (with respect to the given bases).
Proof. By definition the matrix of 80 T is the matrix of 8 0 T = X-I 0 (8 0 T) 0 cp
in Hom(lR n , 1R1), where cp and x are the given basis isomorphisms for U and lV.
But if I/; is the basis isomorphism for V, we have
80 T =

(x- 1 0801/;) 0 (1/;-1 0 To cp) = ;S 0 T,

and therefore its matrix is the product of the matrices of ;S and T by the definition of matrix multiplication. The latter are the matrices of 8 and Twith respect
to the given bases. Putting these observations together, we have the theorem. D
There is a simple relationship between matrix products and transposition.
Theorem 4.6. If the matrix product 8t is defined, then so is t*8*, and
t*8* = (8t)*.

Proof. A direct calculation is easy. We have

This identity is clearly the matrix form of the transformation identity
T)* = T* 0 8*, and it can be deduced from the latter identity if desired.

We can view an n-tuple x = -<Xb"" xn>
as being alternatively either an n X 1 matrix, in which case we call it a column
vector, or a 1 X n matrix, in which case we call it a row vector. Of course, these
identifications are natural isomorphisms. The point of doing this is, in part, that
then the equations Yi = L.f=l tijXj say exactly that the column vector y is the
matrix product of t and the column vector x, that is, y = t· x. The linear map
Cartesian vectors as matrices.

T: IR n ~ IR m becomes left multiplication by the fixed matrix t when IR n is viewed as
the space of n X 1 column vectors. For this reason we shall take the column

vector as the standard matrix interpretation of an n-tuple x; then x* is the
corresponding row vector.

94

VECTOU SPACES

In particular, a linear functional F E (IRn)* becomes left multiplication by
its matrix, which is of course 1 X n (F being from IR n to 1R1), and therefore is
simply the row matrix interpretation of an n-tuple in IRn. That is, in the natural
isomorphism a f-+ La from IR n to (IRn)*, where La(x) = L~ aiXi, the functional
La can now be interpreted as left matrix multiplication by the n-tuple a viewed
as the row vector a*. The matrix product of the row vector (1 X n matrix) a*
and the column vector (n X 1 matrix) x is a 1 X 1 matrix a*· x, that is, a
number.
Let us now see what these observations say about T*. The number La (T(x»
is the 1 X 1 matrix a*tx. Since La(T(x» = (T*(La»(x) by the definition of
T*, we see that the functional T*(La) is left multiplication by the row vector
a*t. Since the row vector form of La is a* and the row vector form of T*(La) is
a*t, this shows that when the functionals on IR n are interpreted as row vectors,
T* becomes right multiplication by t. This only repeats something we already
know. If we take transposes to throw the row vectors into the standard column
vector form for n-tuples, it shows that T* is left multiplication by t*, and so
gives another proof that the matrix of T* is t*.
Change of basis. If cP: x f-+ ~ = L~ xif3i and (j: y f-+ ~ = L~ Yif3i are two basis
isomorphisms for V, then A = (j-l 0 cP is the isomorphism in Hom(lR n) which
takes the coordinate n-tuple x of a vector ~ with respect to the basis {f3i} into the
coordinate n-tuple y of the same vector with respect to the basis {f3i}. The
isomorphism A is called the "change of coordinates" isomorphism. In terms
of the matrix a of A, we have y = ax, as above.
The change of coordinate map A = (j-l 0 cP should not be confused with the
similar looking T = (j 0 cP -1. The latter is a mapping on V, and is the element
of Hom(V) which takes each f3i to f3i.

We now want to see what happens to the matrix of a transformation
T E Hom(V, W) when we change bases in its domain and codomain spaces.
Suppose then that CPl and CP2 are basis isomorphisms from IRn to V, that 1/11 and 1/12
are basis isomorphisms from IR m to W, and that t' and t" are the matrices of T
with respect to the first and second bases, respectively. That is, t' is the matrix
of T' = (1/11)-1 0 To CPl E Hom(lRn, IR m ), and similarly for t". The mapping
A = cp;-1 0 CPl E Hom(lRn) is the change of coordinates transformation for
V: if x is the coordinate n-tuple of a vector ~ with respect to the first basis
[that is, ~ = CPl (x)], then A (x) is its coordinate n-tuple with respect to the second
basis. Similarly, let B be the change of coordinates map 1/1;-1 01/11 for W. The
diagram in Fig. 2.2 will help keep the various relationships of these spaces and

2.4

mappings straight. We say that the diagram is commutative, which means that
any two paths between two points represent the same map. By selecting various
pairs of paths, we can read off all the identities which hold for the nine maps
T, T', Til, <PI, <P2, A, 1/Ib 1/12, B. For example, Til can be obtained by going backward along A, forward along T', and then forward along B. That is, Til =
BoT' 0 A-I. Since these "outside maps" are all maps of Cartesian spaces, we
can then read off the corresponding matrix identity
til

showing how the matrix of T with respect to the second pair of bases is obtained
from its matrix with respect to the first pair.
What we have actually done in reading off the above identity from the
diagram is to eliminate certain retraced steps in the longer path which the
definitions would give us. Thus from the definitions we get

In the above situation the domain and codomain spaces were different, and
the two basis changes were independent of each other. If W = V, so that
T E Hom(V), then of course we consider only one basis change and the formula
becomes
t" = a· t' . a-I.

Now consider a linear functional FE V*. If f" and f' are its coordinate
n-tuples considered as column vectors (n X 1 matrices), then the matrices of F
with respect to the two bases are the row vectors (f')* and (f")*, as we saw
earlier. Also, there is no change of basis in the range space since here W = IR,
with its permanent natural basis vector 1. Therefore, b = e in the formula
t" = bt'a-t, and we have (f")* = (f')*a- 1 or
f"

=

(a- 1 )*f'.

We want to compare this with the change of coordinates of a vector
which, as we saw earlier, is given by

~ E

V,

x" = ax'.

These changes go in the oppositive directions (with a transposition thrown in).
For reasons largely historical, functionals F in V* are called covariant vectors,
and since the matrix for a change of coordinates in V is the transpose of the
inverse of the matrix for the corresponding change of coordinates in V*, the
vectors ~ in V are called contravariant vectors. These terms are used in classical
tensor analysis and differential geometry.
The isomorphism {tij} f-t T, being from a Cartesian space IRmXn, is automatically a basis isomorphism. Its basis in Hom(V, W) is the image under the
isomorphism of the standard basis in IRmXn, where the latter is the set of
Kronecker functions ,p defined by ~kl(i, j) = 0 if <. k, l> ¢ <. i, j> and
~kl(k, l) = 1. (Remember that in IRA, ~a is that function such that ~a(b) = 0

basi" vector in V to the !.th basis vector in TV and takes the other basis vectors
in V to O.
If ~ = L: :ri(Xi, it follows that Dkl(~) = XI(3".
Since {D kl } is the basis defined by the isomorphi"l1l {tij} ~ T, it follows
that {tij} is the coordinate set of T with respect to this basis; it is thc image of T
under the coordinate isomorphism. It is interesting to see how this basis expan"ion of T automatically appear::;. We have

5. TRACE AND DETERMINANT

Our aim in this short section is to acquaint the reader with two very special
real-valued functions on Hom V and to describe some of their properties.
Theorem 5.1. If V is an n-dimensional vector space, there is exactly one
linear functional A on the vector space Hom(V) with the property that
A(S 0 T) = A(T 0 S) for all S, Tin Hom(V) and normalized so that A(I) = n.
If a basis is chosen for V and the corresponding matrix of T is {tij}, then
A(T) = L:i'=1 tii, the sum of the elements on the main diagonal.
Proof. If we choose a basis and define A(T) as L:~ tii, then it is clear that A is a
linear functional on Hom(V) and that A(I) = n. Moreover,

That is, each basis for V gives us a functional A in (Hom V) * such that A(S 0 T) =
A(T 0 S), A(l) = n, and A(T) = L: tii for the matrix representation of that basis.
N ow suppose that J..I. is any element of (Hom(V)) * such that J..I.(S 0 T) =
J..I.(T 0 S) and J..I.(I) = n. If we choose a basis for V and use the isomorphism
8: {tij} 1--+ T from ~nXn to Hom V, we have a functional v = J..I. 0 8 on ~nXn
(v = 8*J..I.) such that v(st) = v(ts) and v(e) = n. By Theorem 4.1 (or 3.1) v is
given by a matrix c, v(t) = L:i.j=1 Cijtij, and the equation v(st - ts) = 0
becomes L:i.j,k=1 Cij(Siktkj - Sjktki) = o.
Weare going to leave it as an exercise for the reader to show that if l rf m,
then very simple special matrices sand t can be chosen so that this sum reduces
to Clm = 0, and, by a different choice, to Cll - Cmm = O.
Together with the requirement that v(e) = n, this implies that Clm = 0 for
l rf m and Cmm = 1 for m = 1, ... ', n. That is, v(t) = L:~ t mm , and v is the
A of the basis being used. Altogether this shows that there is a unique A in
(Hom V)* such that A(S 0 T) = A(T 0 S) for all Sand T and A(I) = n, and that
A(T) has the diagonal evaluation as L: tii in every basis. 0
This unique A is called the trace functional, and A(T) is the trace of T. It is
usually designated tr(T).
The determinant function tl(T) on Hom V is much more complicated, and
we shall not prove that it exists until Chapter 7. Its geometric meaning is as
follows. First, [tl(T)[ is the factor by which T multiplies volumes. More precisely, if we define a "volume" v for subsets of V by choosing a basis and using
the coordinate correspondence to transfer to V the "natural" volume on ~n,
then, for any figure A C V, v(T[AJ) = [tl(T)/. v(A). This will be spelled out in
Chapter 8. Second, tl(T) is positive or negative according as T preserves or
reverses orientation, which again is a sophisticated notion to be explained later.
For the moment we shall list properties of tl(T) that are related to this geometric
interpretation, and we give a sufficient number to show the uniqueness of tl.

b) If a subspace N of V is invariant under T and T is the identity on Nand

d(T) = 1. Such a T is a shearing of V along the planes parallel to N.
In two dimensions it can be pictured as in Fig. 2.3.

d) If V is one-dimensional, so that any Tin Hom(V) is simply multiplication
by a constant CT, then d(T) is that constant CT.
e) If V is two-dimensional and T interchanges a pair of independe~t vectors,
then d(T) = -1. This is clearly a pure orientation-changing property.
The fact that d is uniquely determined by these properties will follow from
our discussion in the next section, which will also give us a process for calculating
d. This process is efficient for dimensions greater than two, but for Tin Hom(1R2)
there is a simple formula for d(T) which every student should know by heart.
Theorem 5.2. If T is in Hom(1R2) and {tij} is its 2 X 2 matrix, then

d(T) =

tllt22 -

t 12 t 21 ·

This is a special case of a general formula, which we shall derive in Chapter 7,
that expresses d(T) as a sum of n! terms, each term being a product of n numbers
from the matrix of T. This formula is too complicated to be useful in computations for large n, but for n = 3 it is about as easy to use as our row-reduction
calculation in the next section, and for n = 2 it becomes the above simple
expression. There are a few more properties of d with which every student
should be familiar. They will all be proved in Chapter 7.
Theorem 5.3. If T isin Hom V, then d(T*) = d(T). If 8 is an isomorphism
from V to Wand S = (J 0 ToO-l, then d(S) = d(T).

Theorem 5.4. The transformation Tis nonsingular (invertible) if and only
if A(T) ~ O.
In the next theorem we consider T in Hom Rn, and we want to think of A(T)
as a function of the matrix t of T. To emphasize this we shall use the notation
D(t)

Show that if Ll(s)

6. MATRIX COMPUTATIONS

The computational process by which the reader learned to solve systems of
linear equations in secondary school algebra was undoubtedly "elimination by
successive substitutions". The first equation is solved for the first unknown, and
the solution expression is substituted for the first unknown in the remaining
equations, thereby eliminating the first unknown from the remaining equations.
Next, the second equation is solved for the second unknown, and this unknown is
then eliminated from the remaining equations. In this way the unknowns are
eliminated one at a time, and a solution is obtained.
This same procedure also solves the following additional problems:
1) to obtain an explicit basis for the linear span of a set of m vectors in IRn;
therefore, in particular,
2) to find the dimension of such a subspace;
3) to compute the determinant of an m X m matrix;
4) to compute the inverse of an invertible m X m matrix.

2.6

MATRIX COMPUTATIONS

103

In this section we shall briefly study this process and the solutions to these
problems.
We start by noting that the kinds of changes we are going to make on a
finite sequence of vectors do not alter its span.
Lemma 6.1. Let {ai}'f be any m-tuple of vectors in a vector space, and let
{i3i} 'f be obtained from {ai} 'f by anyone of the following elementary
operations:
1) interchanging two vectors;
2) multiplying some ai by a nonzero scalar;
3) replacing ai by ai - xaj for some j ~ i and some x E R
Then
L( {i3iH) = L( {ai}'f).

Proof. If ai = ai - xaj, then ai = ai + Xaj. Thus if {i3i} 'f is obtained from
{ai}'f by one operation of type (3), then {ai}'f can be obtained from {i3i}'f by
one operation of type (3). In particular, each sequence is in the linear span of
the other, and the two linear spans are therefore the same.
Similarly, each of the other operations can be undone by one of the same
type, and the linear spans are unchanged. 0
When we perform these operations on the sequence of TOW vectors in a
matrix, we call them elementary row operations.
We define the order of an n-tuple x = <Xb"" x n > as the index of the
first nonzero entry. Thus if Xi = for i < j and Xj ~ 0, then the order of x
isj. The order of <0,0,0,2, -1,0> is 4.
Let {aij} be an m X n matrix, let V be its row space, and let nl < n2 <
... < nk be the integers that occur as orders of nonzero vectors in V. We are
going to construct a basis for V consisting of k elements having exactly the
above set of orders.
If every nonzero row in {aij} has order >p, then every nonzero vector x in
V has order> p, since x is a linear combination of these row vectors. Since some
vector in V has the minimal order nb it follows that some row in {aij} has order
1£1. We move such a row to the top by interchanging two rows. We then multiply
this row x by a constant, so that its first nonzero entry x n1 is 1. Let a 1, ... , an
be the row vectors that we now have, so that a 1 has order nl and a~l = 1. We
next subtract multiples of a 1 from each of the other rows in such a way that the
new ith row has as its nl-coordinate. Specifically, we replace a i by a i a
for i > 1. The matrix that we thus obtain has the property that its jth column
is the zero m-tuple for eachj < n1 and its n1th column is 15 1 in IRm. Its first row
has order nb and every other row has order >nl' Its row space is still V. We
again call it a.
Now let x = I:'f cia i be a vector in V with order n2. Then Cl = 0, for if
Cl ~ 0, then the order of x is nl. Thus x is a linear combination of the second

°

°

a;.l· 1

104

2.6

FINITE-DIMEXSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

to the mth rows, and, just as in the first case, one of these rows must therefore
have order n2.
We now repeat the above process all over again, keying now on this vector.
We bring it to the second row, make its n2-coordinate 1, and subtract multiples
of it from all the other rows (including the first), so that the resulting matrix
has 52 for its n2th column. Next we find a row with order n3, bring it to the
third row, and make the n3th column 53, etc.
We exhibit this process below for one 3 X 4 matrix. This example is dishonest in that it has been chosen so that fractions will not occur through the
application of (2). The reader will not be that lucky when he tries his hand.
Our defense is that by keeping the matrices simple we make the process itself
more apparent.

Note that from the final matrix we can tell that the orders in the row space
are 1, 2, and 4, whereas the original matrix only displays the orders 1 and 2.
We end up with an m X n matrix having the same row space V and the
following special structure:
1) For 1

:s; j :s;

k the jth row has order nj.

< m, the remaining m - k rows are zero (since a nonzero row would
have order >nk, a contradiction).

2) If k

3) The njth column is 5j •

It follows that any linear combination of the first k rows with coefficients
has Cj in the njth place, and hence cannot be zero unless all the
c/s are zero. These k rows thus form a basis for V, solving problems (1) and (2).
Our final matrix is said to be in row-reduced echelon form. It can be shown to
be uniquely determined by the space V and the above requirements relating its
rows to the orders of the elements of V. Its rows form the canonical basis of V.

A typical row-reduced echelon matrix is shown in Fig. 2.4. This matrix is 8 X 11,
its orders are 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, and its row space has dimension 5. It is entirely 0
below the broken line. The dashes in the first five lines represent arbitrary numbers, but any change in these remaining entries changes the spanned space V.
We shall now look for the significance of the row-reduction operations from
the point of view of general linear theory. In this discussion it will be convenient
to use the fact from Section 4 that if an n-tuplet in IR n is viewed as an n X 1
matrix (i.e., as a column vector), then the system of linear equations Yk =
L:.i=1 aiixj, i = 1, ... , m, expresses exactly the single matrix equation y = a' x.
Thus the associated linear transformation A E Hom(lR n, IRm) is now viewed as
being simply multiplication by the matrix a; y = A(x) if and only if y = a· x.

We first note that each of our elementary row operations on an m X n
matrix a is equivalent to premultiplication by a corresponding m X m elementary
matrix u. Supposing for the moment that this is so, we can find out what u
is by using the m X m identity matrix e. Since U· a = (u· e) . a, we see that
the result of performing the operation on the matrix a can also be obtained by
premultiplying a by the matrix u . e. That is, if the elementary operation can
be obtained as matrix multiplication by u, then the multiplier is u . e. This
argument suggests that we should perform the operation on e and then see if
premultiplying a by the resulting matrix performs the operation on a.
If the elementary operation is interchanging the ioth and ioth rows, then
performing it on e gives the matrix a with Ukk = 1 for k ~ io and k ~ io,
uioio = Uioio = 1 and Ukl = 0 for all other indices. Moreover, examination of
the sums defining the elements of the product matrix u . a will show that premultiplying by this u does just interchange the ioth and ioth rows of any
In X n matrix a.
In the same way, multiplying the ioth row of a by c is equivalent to premultiplying by the matrix u which is the same as e except that Uioio = c.
Finally, multiplying theioth row by x and adding it to the ioth row is equivalent
to premultiplying by the matrix u which is the identity e except that uioio is x
instead of O.

These elementary matrices u are all nonsingular (invertible). The row interchange matrix is its own inverse. The inverse of multiplying the jth row by e
is multiplying the same row by lie. And the inverse of adding e times the jth
row to the ith row is adding -e times the jth row to the ith row.
If u 1, u 2 , . . . , uP is a sequence of elementary matrices, and if
b

u\

then b· a is the matrix obtained from a by performing the corresponding
sequence of elementary row operations on a. If u \ ... , uP is a sequence which
row reduces a, then r = b· a is the resulting row-reduced echelon matrix.
Now suppose that a is a square m X m matrix and is nonsingular (invertible).
Thus the dimension of the row space is m, and hence there are m different orders
n}, ... ,nk' That is, k = m, and since 1 ~ nl < n2 < ... < nm = m, we
must also have ni = i, i = 1, ... ,m. Remembering that the nith column in r is
5\ we see that now the ith column in r is 5i and therefore that r is simply the
identity matrix e. Thus b . a = e and b is the inverse of a.

Check it if you are in doubt.
Finally, since h· e = h, we see that we get h from e by applying the same
row operations (gathered together as premultiplication by h) that we used to
reduce a to echelon form. This is probably the best way of computing the inverse
of a matrix. To keep track of the operations, we can place e to the right of a to
form a single m X 2m matrix a I e, and then row reduce it. In echelon form it
will then be the m X 2m matrix e I h, and we can read off the inverse h of the
original matrix a.

Finally we consider the problem of computing the determinant of a square
m X m matrix. We use two elementary operations (one modified) as follows:
1') interchanging two rows and simultaneously changing the sign of one of
them;
2) as before, replacing some row ai by ai - xaj for some j ~ i.
When applied to the 1"OWS of a square matrix, these operations leave the determinant unchanged. This follows from the properties of determinants listed in
Section 5, and its proof will be left as an exercise. Moreover, these properties
will be trivial consequences of our definition of a determinant in Chapter 7.
Consider, then, a square m X m matrix {aij}. We interchange the first
and pth rows to bring a row of minimal order nl to the top, and change the sign
of the row being moved down (the first row here). We do not make the leading

108

2.6

FIXITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

coefficient of the new first row 1; this elementary operation is not being used
now. We do subtract multiples of the first row from the remaining rows, in order
to make all the remaining entries in the nlth column O. The nlth column is now
C10 l , where Cl is the leading coefficient in the first row. And the new matrix has
the same determinant as the original matrix.
We continue as before, subject to the above modifications. We change the
sign of a row moved downward in an interchange, we do not make leading
coefficients 1, and we do clear out the njth column so that it becomes CjOn;,
where Cj is the leading coefficient of the jth row (1 ::=; j ::=; k). As before, the
remaining m - k rows are 0 (if k < m). Let us call this resulting matrix
semireduced. Note that we can find the corresponding reduced echelon matrix
from it by k applications of (2); we simply multiply the jth row by 1/ Cj for
j = 1, ... ,k. If s is the semi reduced matrix which we obtained from a using
(1') and (3), then we shall show below that its determinant, and therefore the
determinant of a also, is the product of the entries on the main diagonal: IIi= 1 sii.
Recapitulating, we can compute the determinant of a square matrix a by using
the operations (1') and (3) to change a to a semireduced matrix s, and then
taking the product of the numbers on the main diagonal of s.
If we apply this process to

we get

and the determinant is 1 . (-2) = -2. Our 2 X 2 determinant formula, applied
to

gives 1 . 4 - 2· 3 = 4 - 6 = -2.
If the original matrix {aij} is nons in gular, so that k = m and ni = i for
i = 1, ... , m, then the jth column in the semireduced matrix is CjOi, so that
Sjj = CiJ and we are claiming that the determinant is the product IIi=l Ci of the
leading coefficients.
To see this, note that if T is the transformation in Hom([Rn) corresponding
to our semireduced matrix, then T( oj) = CjO j , so that [Rn is the direct sum of n
T-invariant, one-dimensional subspaces, on the jth of which T is multiplication
by Cj. It follows from (c) and (d) of our list of determinant properties that
t:.(T) = II~ Cj = II~ Sjj. This is nonzero.
On the other hand, if {aij} is singular, so that k = d(V) < m, then the mth
row in the semi reduced matrix is 0 and, in particular, Smm = O. The product
IIi Sii is thus zero. Now, without altering the main diagonal, we can subtract
multiples of the columns containing the leading row entries (the columns with

2.6

MATRIX COMPUTATIONS

109

indices nj) to make the mth column a zero column. This process is equivalent
to postmultiplying by elementary matrices of type (2) and, therefore, again
leaves the determinant unchanged. But now the transformation S of this matrix
leaves ~m-l invariant (as the span of Clt, ... , Cl m - 1 in ~m) and takes Cl m to 0,
so that t.(S) = 0 by (c) in the list of determinant properties. So again the
determinant is the product of the entries on the main diagonal of the semireduced matrix, zero in this case.
We have also found that a matrix is nonsingular (invertible) if and only if its
determinant is nonzero.

*7. THE DIAGONALIZATION OF A QUADRATIC FORM

As we mentioned earlier, one of the crucial problems of linear algebra is the
analysis of the "structure" of a linear transformation T in Hom V. From the
point of view of bases, every theorem in this area asserts that with the choice
of a special basis for V the matrix of T can be given the such-and-such simple
form. This is a very difficult part of the subject, and ,ye are only making contact with it in this book, although Theorem 5.5 of Chapter 1 and its corollary
form a cornerstone of the structural results.
In this section we are going to solve a simpler problem. In the above language it is the problem of choosing a basis for V making simple the matrix of a
transformation T in Hom(V, V*). Such a transformation is equivalent to a
bilinear functional on V (by Theorem 6.1 of Chapter 1 and Theorem 3.2 of this
chapter); we shall tackle the problem in this setting.

112

2.7

FINITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

Let V be a finite-dimensional real vector space, and let w: V X V ~ IR be
a bilinear functional. If {aig is a basis for V, then w determines a matrix
tij = w(ai' aj). We know that if w'l(~) = w(~, 7]), then W'l E V* and 7] 1-+ W'l is a
linear mapping T from V to V*. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to
show that {tij} is the matrix of T with respect to the basis {ai} for V and its
dual basis for V* (Exercise 4.1).
If ~ = L~ Xiai and 7] = L~ Yjaj, then
i,i

In particular, if we set q(~) = w(~, ~), then q(~) = Li,j tijXiXj is a homogeneous
quadratic polynomial in the coordinates Xi.
For the rest of this section we assume that w is symmetric: w(~, 7]) =
w(7], ~). Then we can recover w from the quadratic form q by

as the reader can easily check. In particular, if the bilinear form w is not identically zero, then there are vectors ~ such that q(~) =
~) ~ O.
What we want to do is to show that we can find a basis {aig for V such that
w(ai' aj) = 0 if i ~ j and w(ai' ai) has one of the three values 0, ± 1. Borrowing from the standard usage of scalar product theory (see Chapter 5), we say
that such a basis is orthonormal. Our proof that an orthonormal basis exists will
be an induction on n = dim V. If n = 1, then any nonzero vector (3 is a basis,
and if w({3, (3) ~ 0, then we can choose a = x{3 so that x 2 w({3, (3) = w(a, a) =
±I, the required value of X obviously being x = /w({3, (3)/-1/2. In the general
case, if w is the zero functional, then any basis will trivially be orthonormal, and
we can therefore suppose that w is not identically O. Then there exists a (3 such
that w({3, (3) ~ 0, as we noted earlier. We set an = x{3, where x is chosen to
make q(a n) = wean, an) = ±1. The nonzero linear functionalf(~) = w(~, an)
has an (n - I)-dimensional null space N, and if we let w' be the restriction of
w to N X N, then w' has an orthonormal basis {aig- 1 by the inductive hypothesis. Also w(ai' an) = wean, ai) = 0 if i < n, because ai is in the null space of f.
Therefore, {aig is an orthonormal basis for w, and we have reached our goal:

wa,

real vector space V, then V has an w-orthonormal basis.

where q( ai) = ± 1 or O. If we let V 1 be the span of those basis vectors ai for
which q(ai) = 1, and similarly for V -1 and V o, then we see that q(~) > 0 for
every nonzero ~ in V b q(~) < 0 for every nonzero vector ~ in V - b and q = 0

THE DIAGONALIZATION OF A QUADRATIC FORM

on Vo. Furthermore, V = V 1 9 V -1 9 V 0, and the three subspaces are
w-orthonormal to each other (which means that w{~, 71) = 0 if ~ E V 1 and
71 E V -1> etc.). Finally, q(~) ::; 0 for every ~ in V -1 9 Yo·
If we choose another orthonormal basis {~i} and let W 1, W -1, and W 0 be
its corresponding subspaces, then W 1 may be different from V 1, but their dimensions must be the same. For W 1 n (V -1 9 V 0) = {O}, since any nonzero ~
in this intersection would yield the contradictory inequalities q(~) > 0 and
q(~) ::; o. Thus W 1 can be extended to a complement of V -1 9 Yo, and since
V 1 is a complement, we have d(W 1) ::; d(V 1). Similarly, d(V 1) ::; d(W 1),
and the dimensions therefore are equal. Incidentally, this shows that W 1 is a
complement of V -1 9 Yo. In exactly the same way, we find that d(W -1) =
d(V -1) and finally, by subtraction, that d(W 0) = d(Vo). It is conventional to
reorder an w-orthonormal basis {ai} 1so that all the a/s with q(ai) = 1 come first,
then those with q(ai) = -1, and finally those with q(ai) = o. Our results
above can then be stated as follows:
Theorelll 7.2. If w is a symmetric bilinear functional on a finite-dimensional

space V, then there are integers nand p such that if {ai} '{' is any w-orthonormal basis in conventional order, and if ~ = L:,{, Xiai, then

+ ... + x; =:E x~ - p+1

The integer p - n is called the signature of the form q (or its associated
symmetric bilinear functional w), and p
n is its rank. Note that p
n is the
dimension of the column space of the above matrix of q, and hence equals the
dimension of the range of the related linear map T. Therefore, p
n is the
rank of every matrix of q.
An inductive proof that an orthonormal basis exists doesn't show us how to
find one in practice. Let us suppose that we have the matrix {tii} of w with
respect to some basis {aig before us, so that w(~, 71) = L: XiYitij, where
~
L:1 Xiai, 71 1:1 Yiai, and tii w(ai' ai), and we want to know how to go
about actually finding an orthonormal basis {~i} 1. The main problem is to find
an orthogonal basis; normalization is then trivial. The first objective is to find
a vector ~ such that w(~,
0;6- o. If some tii = w(ai' ai) is not zero, we can take
~ = ai. If all tii = 0 and the form w is not the zero form, there must be some
Iii 0;6- 0, say t12 0;6- O. If we set 1'1 = a1
a2 and I'i = ai for i > 1, then {I'ig
is a basis, and the matrix s = {Sii} of w with respect to the basis {-Y i} has

= W(I'1> 1'1) = w(a1 + a2, a1 + a2) = tll + 2t12 + t22 = 2t12 0;6- O.

Similarly, sii = tii if either i or j is greater than 1.
For example, if w is the bilinear form on 1R2 defined by w(x, y)
X2Y1, then its matrix tii = w(,si, ,si) is

+

114

and we must change the basis to get tt 1 ~ o. According to the above scheme,
we set 'Yl = 15 1
15 2 and 'Y2 = 15 2 and get the new matrix Sij = W('Yi' 'Yj),
which works out to

+

~].

[i

The next step is to find a basis for the null space of the functional w(~, 'Y 1) =
We do this by modifying 'Y 2, ... , 'Y n; we replace 'Y j by 'Y j
e'Y 1 and
calculate e so that this vector is in the null space. Therefore, we want 0 =
w('Yj
e'Yl, 'Yl) = Slj
eS11, and so e = -sljls11. Note that we cannot take
this orthogonalizing step until we have made Sl1 ~ o. The new set still spans
and thus is a basis, and the new matrix {rij} has r11 ~ 0 and rlj = rjl = 0 for
j > 1. We now simply repeat the whole procedure for the restriction of W to this
(n - I)-dimensional null space, with matrix {rij : 2 ~ i, j ~ n}, and so on.
This is a long process, but until we normalize, it consists only of rational operations on the original matrix. We add, subtract, multiply, and divide, but we
do not have to find roots of polynomial equations.
Continuing our above example, we set fh = 'Y b but we have to replace 'Y 2
by fJ2 = 'Y2 - (SI2Is11)'Y1 = 'Y2 - t'Yl. The final matrix rij = W(fJi, fJj)

The final basisisfJl = 'Y 1 = 15 1
c5 2 andfJ2 = 'Y2 - t'Yl = 15 2 - t(c5 1 15 2 )=
(15 2 - 15 1 )/2.
The steps we had to take above are reminiscent of row reduction, but since
we are changing bases simultaneously in the domain and range spaces of the
transformation T: V ---? V* associated with w, each step involves simultaneously
premultiplying and postmultiplying by an elementary matrix. That is, we are
simultaneously row and column reducing. It should be intuitively clear that this
has to be the case if we are to operate on a symmetric matrix in such a way as
to keep it symmetric.
For additional information about quadratic forms, we go back to the change
of basis formula for the matrix of a transformation: til = b· t'· a-I. Here the
transformation T associated with the form w is from V to V*, and so b = (a*)-I,
according to our calculations in Section 4. Now one of the properties of the
determinant function is that d(T*) = d(T), and so d(a*) = d(a). Therefore,
if t and s are the matrices of a quadratic form with respect to a first and second
basis in V, and if a is the change of basis matrix, then s = (a*)-I. t· a-I and
deS) = (d(a- 1))2 d(t). Therefore, a quadratic form has parity. If it is nonsingular, then its determinant is either always positive or always negative, and

we can call it even or odd. In our continuing example, the beginning and final
matrices

[~

~]

and

both have determinant -1.
In the two-dimensional case, the determinant of a form with respect to an
orthonormalized basis is +1 if the diagonal elements are both +1 or both - 1,
and -1 if they are of opposite sign. We can therefore read off the signature of a
nonsingular form over a two-dimensional space without orthonormalizing. If the
determinant t11t22 - (t 12 )2 is positive, the signature is ±2, and we can determine which by looking at t11 (since t11 is then unchanged by our orthogonalizing
procedure). Thus the signature is +2 or -2 depending on whether tIl > 0 or
t11 < o. If the determinant is negative, then the signature is O. Thus the
signature of the form w(x, y) = X1Y2
X2Yr, with matrix

is known to be 0, without any calculation.
Theorems 7.1 and 7.2 are important for the classification of critical points
of real-valued functions on vector spaces. We shall see in Section 3.16 that the
second differential of such a function F is a symmetric bilinear functional, and
that the signature of its form has the same significance in determining the behavior of F near a point at which its first differential is zero that the sign of
the second derivative has in the elementary calculus.
A quadratic form q is said to be definite if q(~) is never zero except for ~ = O.
Then q(~) must always have the same sign, and q is accordingly called positive
definite or negative definite. Looking back to Theorem 7.2, it should be obvious
that q is positive definite only if p = dey) and n = 0, and negative definite
only if n = dey) and p = o. A symmetric bilinear functional whose associated
quadratic form is positive definite is called a scalar product. This is a very
important notion on general vector spaces, and the whole of Chapter 5 is devoted to developing some of its implications.

CHAPTER 3

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

Our algebraic background is now adequate for the differential calculus, but we
still need some multidimensional limit theory. Roughly speaking, the differential calculus is the theory of linear approximations to nonlinear mappings,
and we have to know what we mean by approximation in general vector settings.
We shall therefore start this chapter by studying the notion of a measure of
length, called a norm, for the vectors in a vector space V. We can then study
the phenomenon suggested by the way in which a tangent plane to a surface
approximates the surface near the point of tangency. This is the general theory
of unique local linear approximations of mappings, called differentials. The
collection of rules for computing differentials includes all the familiar laws of
the differential calculus, and achieves the same goal of allowing complicated
calculations to be performed in a routine way. However, the theory is richer
in the multidimensional setting, and one new aspect which we must master is
the interplay between the linear transformations which are differentials and their
evaluations at given vectors, which are directional derivatives in general and
partial derivatives when the vectors belong to a basis. In particular, when the
spaces in question are finite-dimensional and are replaced by Cartesian spaces
through a choice of bases, then the differential is entirely equivalent to its matrix,
which is a certain matrix of partial derivatives called the Jacobian matrix of the
mapping. Then the rules of the differential calculus are expressed in terms of
matrix operations.
Maximum and minimum points of real-valued functions are found exactly
as before, by computing the differential and setting it equal to zero. However,
we shall neglect this subject, except in starred sections. It also is much richer
than its one-variable counterpart, and in certain infinite-dimensional situations
it becomes the subject called the calculus of variations.
Finally, we shall begin our study of the inverse-mapping theorem and the
implicit-function theorem. The inverse-mapping theorem states that if a mapping
between vector spaces is continuously differentiable, and if its differential at a
point a is invertible (as a linear transformation), then the mapping itself is
invertible in the neighborhood of a. The implicit-function theorem states that if
a continuously differentiable vector-valued function G of two vector variables
is set equal to zero, and if the second partial differential of G is invertible (as a
linear mapping) at a point -< a, (3 >- where G(a, (3) = 0, then the equation
116

G(~7J) = 0 can be solved for 7J in terms of ~ near this point. That is, there is a
uniquely determined mapping 7J = F(~) defined near a such that (3 = F(a) and
such that G(~, F(~») = 0 in the neighborhood of a. These two theorems are
fundamental to the further development of analysis. They are deeper results
than our work up to this point in that they depend on a special property of
vector spaces called completeness; we shall have to put off part of their proofs to
the next chapter, where we shall study completeness in a fairly systematic way.
In a number of starred sections at the end of the chapter we present some
harder material that we do not expect the reader to master. However, he should
try to get a rough idea of what is going on.

I. REVIEW IN IR

Every student of the calculus is presumed to be familiar with the properties of
the real number system and the theory of limits. But we shall need more than
familiarity at this point. It will be absolutely essential that the student understand the E-definitions and be able to work with them.
To be on the safe side, we shall review some of this material in the setting of
limits of functions; the confident reader can skip it. We suppose that all the
functions we consider are defined at least on an open interval containing a,
except possibly at a itself. The need for this exception is shown by the difference
quotients of the calculus, which are not defined at the point near which their
hchavior is crucial.

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

For all x closer to a than ~ the value of f at x is closer to l than E. The
definition begins by stating that such a positive ~ can be found for each positive E.
Of course, ~ will vary with E; if E is made smaller, we will generally have to
go closer to a, that is, we will have to take ~ smaller, before all the values of f
on (a - ~, a
~)
{a} become E close to l.
The variables 'E' and '~' are almost always restricted to positive real numbers, and from now on we shall let this restriction be implicit unless there seems
to be some special call for explicitness. Thus we shall write simply ('v'E)(3~) ...
The definition of convergence is used in various ways. In the simplest
situations we are given one or more functions having limits at a, say, f(x) ---+ u
and g(x) ---+ v, and we want to prove that some other function h has a limit 10
at a. In such cases we always try to find an inequality expressing the quantity we
wish to make small, Ih(x) - 101, in terms of the quantities which we know can be
made small, If(x) - ul and Ig(x) - vi.
For example, suppose that h = f
g. Since f(x) is close to u and g(x) is
close to v, clearly hex) is close to 10 = U
v. But how close? Since hex) - 10 =
(f(x) - u)
(g(x) - v), we have

+ -

+
+

+

Ih(x) - 101 ::; If(x) -

ul + Ig(x)

-

vi.

From thi~ it is clear that in order to make Ih(x) - 101 less than E it is sufficient
to make each of If(x) - ul and Ig(x) - vi less than E/2. Therefore, given any E,
we can take ~l so that 0 < Ix - al < ~l => If(x) - ul < E/2, and ~2 so that
o < Ix - al < ~2 => Ig(x) - vi < E/2, and we can then take ~ as the smaller
of these two numbers, so that if 0 < Ix - al < ~, then both inequalities hold.
Thus

o<

Ix -

al < ~

=> Ih(x) - 101 ::; If(x) -

ul

+ Ig(x)

-

vi < ~ + ~ = E,

and we have found the desired ~ for the function h.
Suppose next that u r!= 0 and that h = l/f. Clearly, hex) is close to 10 = l/u
whenf(x) is close to u, and so we try to express hex) - 10 in terms of f(x) - u.
Thus
1
1
u - f(x)
hex) - 10 = f(x) - U = f(x)u '
and so Ih(x) - 101 ::; If(x) - ul/lf(x)ul. The trouble here is that the denominator is variable, and if it should happen to be very small, it might cancel the
smallness of If(x) - ul and not force a small quotient. But the answer to this
problem is easy. Sincef(x) is close to u and u is not zero, f(x) cannot be close to
zero. For instance, if f(x) is closer to u than lul/2, then f(x) must be farther
from 0 than lul/2. We therefore choose ~l so that 0 < Ix - al < ~l =>
If(x) - ul < lul/2, from which it follows that If(x) I > lul/2. Then

In addition to understanding E-techniques in limit theory, it is necessary to

If A is a nonempty subset of ~ such that A c (- 00, a] for some a, then
there exists a uniquely determined smallest number b such that A C (- 00, b].

A number a such that A C (- 00, a] is called an upper bound of A; clearly, a
iH an upper bound of A if and only if every x in A is less than or equal to a.
A set having an upper bound is said to be bounded above. The property says that
a nonempty set A which is bounded above has a least upper bound (lub). If
we reverse the order relation by multiplying everything by -1, then we have the
alternative formulation which asserts that a nonempty subset of ~ that is
hounded below has a greatest lower bound (glb). The least upper bound of the
interval (0, 1) is 1. The least upper bound of [0, 1] is also 1. The greatest lower
hound of {1/n : n a positive integer} is O. Furthermore, lub {x : x is a positive
rational number and x 2 < 2} = 0, glb {ex: x E ~} = 0, and lub {ex: x is
rational and x < 0} = eV2•

rn the limit theory of IR, as reviewed briefly above, the absolute-value function
is used prominently in expressions like' Ix - yl' to designate the distance
between two numbers, here between x and y. The definition of the convergence

The limit theory of vector spaces is studied in terms of functions called
/lOrms, which serve as multidimensional analogues of the absolute-value function
on IR. Thus, if p: V ~ IR is a norm, then we want to interpret pea) as the "size"
of a and pea - (3) as the "distance" between a and (3. However, if V is not
one-dimensional, there is no one notion of size that is most natural. For example,
if f is a positive continuous function on [a, b], and if we ask the reader for a
number which could be used as a measure of how "large" f is, there are two
possibilities that will probably occur to him: the maximum value of f and the area
Ilnder the graph of f. Certainly, f must be considered small if max f is small.
But also, we would have to agree that f is small in a different sense if its area is
small. These are two examples of norms on the vector space V = e([a, b]) of all
(·ontinuous functions on [a, b]:

p(f)

max {If(t) I : t E [a, b]}

and

q(f) =

\"ote that f can be small in the second sense and not in the first.
In order to be useful, a notion of size for a vector must have properties
analogous to those of the absolute-value function on IR.

-< V, p:>, but generally we speak simply of the normed linear space V, a definite
norm on V then being understood.
It has been customary to designate the norm of a by Iiall, presumably to
suggest the analogy with absolute value. The triangle inequality n3 then
becomes Iia + ~II :::; Iiall + II~II. which is almost identical in form with the basic
absolute-value inequality Ix + yl :::; Ixl + Iyl. Similarly, n2 becomes Ilxall =
Ixiliall, analogous to Ixyl = Ixllyl in IR. Furthermore, Iia - ~II is similarly
interpreted as the distance between a and~. This is reasonable since if we set
a = ~ - 71 and ~ = 71 - r, then n3 becomes the usual triangle inequality of
geometry:
II~ - rll :::; II~ - 7111 + 1171 - rll·
We shall use both the double bar notation and the "p"-notation for norms; each
is on occasion superior to the other.
The most commonly used norms on IR n are IlxilI = 1:7 lXii, the Euclidean
norm IIxl12 = (1:7 X~)I/2, and Ilxll oo = max {Ixil}i. Similar norms on the
infinite-dimensional vector space e([a, b)) of all continuous real-valued functions
on [a, b] are

= max {If(t) I : a :::; t :::; b}.

It should be easy for the reader to check that II lit is a norm in both cases
above, and we shall take up the so-called uniform norms II 1100 in the next
paragraph. The Euclidean norms II 112 are trickier; their properties depend on
scalar product considerations. These will be discussed in Chapter 5. :Meanwhile,
so that the reader can use the Euclidean norm II 112 on IR n , we shall ask him to
prove the triangle inequality for it (the other axioms being obvious) by brute
force in an exercise. On IR itself the absolute value is a norm, and it is the only
norm to within a constant multiple.
We can transfer the above norms on IR n to arbitrary finite-dimensional
spaces by the following general remark.
Lemma 2.1. If p is a norm on a vector space Wand T is an injective linear
map from a vector space V to W, then poT is a norm on V.

Proof. The proof is left to the reader.
Uniform norms. The two norms II 1100 considered above are special cases of a
very general situation. Let A be an arbitrary nonempty set, and let <B(A, IR)
be the set of all bounded functionsf: A ~ IR. That is, f E <B(A, IR) if and only if
f E IRA and range f c [-b, b] for some b E IR. This is the same as saying that
range If I c [0, b], and we call any such b a bound of If I· The set <B(A, IR) is a

3.2

NORMS

123

vector space V, since if If I and Igl are bounded by band c, respectively, then
Ixf ygl is bounded by Ixlb
lyle. The uniform norm Ilfll., is defined as the
smallest bound of If I· That is,

+

+

Ilfll., = lub {If(p)1 : pEA}.
Of course, it has to be checked that II II., is a norm. For any p in A,

If(p)

+ g(p)1

:::; If(p) I

+

+

+ Ig(p)1

:::; Ilfll",

+ Ilgll.,·

Thus Ilfll.,
Ilgll., is a bound of If gl and is therefore greater than or equal to
the smallest such bound, which is Ilf glloo. This gives the triangle inequality.
Next we note that if x ~ 0, then b bounds If I if and only if Ixlb bounds Ixfl, and
it follows that Ilxfll., = Ixillfll.,. Finally, Ilfll., ~ 0, and Ilfll., =
only if f is
the zero function.
We can replace IR by any normed linear space W in the above discussion.
A function f: A ---t W is bounded by b if and only if Ilf(p) II :::; b for all p in A,
and we define the corresponding uniform norm on CB(A, W) by

+

°

Ilflloo = lub {lIf(p) II : pEA}.
If f E e([O, 1]), then we know that the continuous function f assumes the
least upper bound of its range as a value (that is, f "assumes its maximum value"),
so that then IIfll., is the maximum value of If I· In general, however, the definition
must be given in terms of lub.
~II is interpreted as the distance from a to ~, it is
natural to define the open ball of radius r about the center a as {~ : II a - ~ II < r}.
We designate this ball Br(a). Translation through (3 preserves distance,

Balls. Remembering that II a -

+

+

and therefore ~ E Br(a) if and only if ~ (3 E Br(a (3). That is, translation
through (3 carries Br(a) into Br(a (3): T(:I[Br(a)] = Br(a (3). Also, scalar
multiplication by c multiplies all distances by c, and it follows in a similar way
that cBr(a) = Bcr(ca).
Although Br(a) behaves like a ball, the actual set being defined is different
for different norms, and some of them "look unspherelike". The unit balls about
the origin in 1R2 for the three norms II 1111 II 112, and II II., are shown in Fig. 3.2.
A subset A of a nls V is bounded if it lies in some ball, say Br(a). Then it
also lies in a ball about the origin, namely Br+llall(O). This is simply the fact that
if II ~ - all < r, then II ~II < r
lIall, which we get from the triangle inequality
upon rewriting II~II as lIa - a)
all.
The radius of the largest ball about a vector {3 which does not touch a set A
is naturally called the distance from {3 to A. It is clearly glb {II ~ - {311 : ~ E A}
(see Fig. 3.3).

A point ex is an interior point of a set A if some ball about ex is included in A.
This is equivalent to saying that the distance from ex to the complement of A is
positive (supposing that A is not the whole of V), and should coincide with
the reader's intuitive notion of what an "inside" point should be. A subset A
of a normed linear space is said to be open if every point of A is an interior
point.
If our language is to be consistent, an open ball should be an open set. It is:
if ex E B r({3), then Ilex - (311 < r, and then Ba(ex) C B r({3), provided that 0 :;:; r "ex - {311, by virtue of the triangle inequality (see Fig. 3.4). The reader should
write down the detailed proof. He has to show that if ~ E Ba(ex), then ~ E Br({3).
Our intuitions about distances are quite trustworthy, but they should always be
checked by a computation. The reader probably can see by a mental argument
that the union of any collection of open sets is open. In particular, the union of
any collection of open balls is open (Fig. 3.5), and this is probably the most
intuitive way of visualizing an open set. (See Exercise 2.9.)

A subset C is said to be closed if its complement C' is open.
Our discussion above shows that a non empty set C is closed if and only if
every point not in it is at a positive distance from it: ex ~ C =? p(ex, C) > o.
The so-called closed ball of radius r about {3, B = H : ,,~ - {311 :;:; r}, is a closed
set. As Fig. 3.6 suggests, the proof is another application of the triangle inequality.

3. CONTINUITY

Let V and W be any two normed linear spaces. We shall designate both norms
by II II. This ambiguous usage does not cause confusion. It is like the ambiguous
use of "0" for the zero elements of all the vector spaces under consideration. If we
replace the absolute value sign I I by the general norm symbol II II in the
definition we gave earlier for the limit of a real-valued function of a real variable,
it becomes verbatim the corresponding definition of convergence in the general
setting. However, we shall repeat the definition and take the occasion to relax
the hypothesis on the domain of f. Accordingly, let A by any subset of V, and let
f be any mapping from A to W.
Definition. We say that f(~) approaches (3 as ~ approaches a, and write
as ~ ~ a, if for every E there is a 0 such that

f(~) ~ {3

~ E

A and 0

< II ~ - all <

0 => IlfW -

(311 <

E.

If a E A and f(~) ~ f(a) as ~ ~ a, then we say that f is continuous at a.
We can then drop the requirement that ~ ~ a and have the direct E,Ocharacterization of continuity: f is continuous at a if for every E there exists a 0
such that II ~ - all < 0 => IlfW - f(a) II < E. It is understood here that ~ is
universally quantified over the domain A of f. We say that f is continuous if f is
continuous at every point a in its domain. If the absolute value of a number is
replaced by the norm of a vector, the limit theorems that we sampled in Section 1
hold verbatim for normed linear spaces. We shall ask the reader to write out a
few of these transcriptions in the exercises.
There is a property stronger than continuity at a which is much simpler to
use when it is available. We say that f is Lipschitz continuous at a if there is a
constant c such that IIf(~) - f(a) II ::; cll ~ - all for all ~ sufficiently close to a.

3.3

CONTINUITY

127

That is, there are constants c and r such that

II t - all <

r => IIf(t) - f(a) II

::; cll t - all·

The point is that now we can take 8 simply as E/c (provided E is small enough so
that this makes 8 ::; r; otherwise we have to set 8 = min {E/C, r}). We say
that f is a Lipschitz function (on its domain A) if there is a constant c such that
Ilf(~) - f(7J) II ::; cllt - 7111 for all t,7J in A. For a linear map T: V ~ W the
Lipschitz inequality is more simply written as

~ E V; we just use the fact that now T(~) - T(7J) = T(t - 71) and set
t - 71. In this context it is conventional to call T a bounded linear mapping

for all
~ =

rather than a Lipschitz linear mapping, and any such c is called a bound of T.
We know from the beginning calculus that if f is a continuous real-valued
function on [a, b) (that is, if f E e([a, b))), then II: f(x) £lxl ::; m(b - a), where
m is the maximum value of If(x)l. But this is just the uniform norm of f, so that
the inequality can be rewritten as II: fl ::; (b - a) 111!100. This shows that if the
uniform norm is used on e([a, b)), then f 1---+ I: f is a bounded linear functional,
with bound b - a.
It should immediately be pointed out that this is not the same notion of
boundedness we discussed earlier. There we called a real-valued function
bounded if its range was a bounded subset of IR. The analogue here would be to
call a vector-valued function bounded if its range is norm bounded. But a
nonzero linear transformation cannot be bounded in this sense, because

II T(xa) II

=

IxIIIT(a)ll·

The present definition amounts to the boundedness in the earlier sense of the
quotient T(a)/iiall (on V - {O}). It turns out that for a linear map T, being
continuous and being Lipschitz are the same thing.
TheoreDl 3.1. Let T be a linear mapping from a normed linear space V to a

normed linear space W. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
1) T is continuous at one point;
2) T is continuous;
3) T is bounded.

Proof. (1) => (3). Suppose T is continuous at ao. Then, taking E = 1, there
exists 8such that lIa - aoll < 8=> IIT(a) - T(ao)1I < 1. Setting t = a - ao
and using the additivity of T, we have II til < 8=> II T( t) II < 1. Now for any
nonzero 71, t = 871/2117111 has norm 8/2. Therefore, IIT(t)1I < 1. But
IIT(t)11 = 8I1T(7J)11/2117J11, giving IIT(7J)1I < 2117111/8. Thus T is bounded by
C = '2/8.

lIa - {311· Similarly, II{311 - lIall ~ 1I{3 - all = lIa - {311. This pair of inequalities is equivalent to the lemma. 0

Other Lipschitz mappings will appear when we study mappings with continuous differentials. Roughly speaking, the Lipschitz property lies between
continuity and continuous differentiability, and it is frequently the condition
that we actually apply under the hypothesis of continuous differentiability.
The smallest bound of a bounded linear transformation T is called its norm.
That is,
IITII = lub {IIT(a)lI/l1all : a ~ O}.
For example, let T: e([a, b]) ---+ ~ be the Riemann integral, T(f) = I: f(x) dx.
We saw earlier that if we use the uniform norm IIfll", on e([a, b)), then T is
bounded by b - a: IT(f)1 ~ (b - a)lIfll",. On the other hand, there is no smaller
bound, because I: 1 = b - a = (b - a) II 111",· Thus IITII = b - a. Other
formulations of the above definition are useful. Since
IIT(a)lI/l1all

=

IIT(alllall)1I

by homogeneity, and since {3 = aillall has norm 1, we have
IITII = lub {IIT({3)1I : 1I{311 = 1}.

Finally, if II"YII ~ 1, then"Y

We therefore have an inefficient but still useful characterization:

These last two formulations are uniform norms. Thus, if B I is the closed unit
ball H : II ~II ~ 1}, we see that a linear T is bounded if and only if T fBI is

I\[C] includes the ball B = B r /7('Y) , where 'Y = [((a). This proof is elementary but
tricky. If there is a point v of B not in [([CJ, then since K[C] is closed, there is a largest
hall B' about v disjoint from K[C] and a point 1/ = K(~) in [([C] as close to B' as we

exercises.
3.22 We shall see in the next chapter that if V and Tr are finite-dimensional spaces,
then any continuom, map from V to Tr takes bounded closed sets into bounded closed
sets. Assuming this and the results of the above exercises, prove the following theorem.
Theorem. Let F be a mapping from an open subset A of a finite-dimensional
normed linear space V to a finite-dimensional normed linear space W. Suppose
that there is a T in Hom(V, lV) such that T-I exists and such that F - T is
Lipschitz on A, with constant 112m, where m = liT-III. Then F is injective, its
range R = F[.I] is an open subset of 11', and its inverse F-I is Lipschitz continuous, with constant 2m.
4. EQUIVALENT NORMS

Two normed linear spaces V and Ware norm isomorphic if there is a bijection T
from V to W such that T E Hom(V, W) and T- I E Hom(W, V). That is, an
isomorphism is a linear isomorphism T such that both T and T- I are continuous
(bounded). As usual, we regard isomorphic spaces as being essentially the same.
For two different norms on the same space we are led to the following definition.
Definition. Two norms p and q on the same vector space V are equivalent
if there exist constants a and b such that p ~ aq and q ~ bp.

Then (l/b)q ~ P ~ aq and (l/a)p ~ q ~ bp, so that two norms are
equivalent if and only if either can be bracketed by two multiples of the other.
The above definition simply says that the identity map ~ ~ ~ from V to V,
considered as a map from the normed linear space -< V, p>- to the normed
linear space -< V, q>-, is bounded in both directions, and hence that these two
normed linear spaces are isomorphic.
If V is infinite-dimensional, two norms will in general not be equivalent.
For example, if V = e([O, 1]) and fn(t) = tn, then Ilfnlll = l/(n
1) and
Ilinlloo = 1. Therefore, there is no constant a such that lIilloo ~ aililil for all
f E e[O, 1], and the norms II 1100 and II III are not equivalent on V = era, b].
This is why the very notion of a normed linear space depends on the assumption
of a given norm.
However, we have the following theorem, which we shall prove in the next
chapter by more sophisticated methods than we are using at present.

+

Theorem 4.1. On a finite-dimensional vector space Vall norms are equiva-

lent.
We shall need this theorem and also the following consequence of it occasionally in the present chapter.
Theorem 4.2. If V and Ware finite-dimensional normed linear spaces, then

every linear mapping T from V to W is necessarily bounded.

3.4

EQUIVALENT NORMS

133

Proof. Because of the above theorem, it is sufficient to prove T bounded with
respect to some pair of norms. Let (J: IR n ~ V and cp: IR m~ W be any basis
isomorphisms, and let {tii} be the matrix of T = cp-l 0 To (J in Hom(lR n, IRm).
Then

where b = max Itiil. Now q(T/) = IIcp-I(T/) 1100 and p(~) = II(J-I(~)III are norms
on Wand V respectively,. by Lemma 2.1, and since
q(T(~)

=

liT(o-l~)lloo

::;

bll(J-I~III

=

bp(~),

we see that T is bounded by b with respect to the norms p and q on V and W. D
If we change to an equivalent norm, we are merely passing through an
isomorphism, and all continuous linear properties remain unchanged. For
example:
Theorem 4.3. The vector space Hom(V, W) remains the same if either the

domain norm or the range norm is replaced by an equivalent norm, and the
two induced norms on Hom(V, W) are equivalent.
Proof. The proof is left to the reader.

We now ask what kind of a norm we might want on the Cartesian product
V X W of two normed linear spaces. It is natural to try to choose the product
norm so that the fundamental mappings relating the product space to the two
factor spaces, the two projections 7ri and the two injections (Ji, should be continuous. It turns out that these requirements determine the product norm
uniquely to within equivalence. For if II < a, ~ >- II has these properties, then

I <a, 0>- + <0, ~>- II ::; II <a, 0>- II + II <0, ~>- II
::; kliiall + k211 ~II ::; k(llall + II ~II),
where k i is a bound of the injection (Ji and k is the larger of kl and k 2 . Also,
Iiall ::; cI11 <a, ~>- II and II~II ::; c211 <a, ~>- II, by the boundedness of the projections 7ri, and so Iiall + II~II ::; cll <a, ~>- II, where c = C1 + C2. Now Iiall +
I ~II is clearly a norm II I! 1 on V X W, and our argument above shows that
I! <a, ~ >- II will satisfy our requirements if and only if it is equivalent to II Ill.

Any such norm will be called a product norm for V X W. The product norms

form and Euclidean norms actually are norms as exercises.
Each of these three product norms can be defined as well for n factor spaces
as for two, and we gather the facts for this general case into a theorem.

Theorem 4.4. If { -< Vi, Pi'?

is a finite set of normed linear spaces, then
II II I, II 112, and II II"" defined on V = IIi=l Vi by lIalll = L~ Pi(ai),
IIal12 = (L~ Pi(aY) 1/2, and Ilall", = max {Pi(ai) : i = 1, ... ,n}, are
equivalent norms on V, and each is a product norm in the sense that the
projections 7ri and the injections (Ji are all continuous.

* It looks above as though all we are doing is taking any norm

norm on IR n an increasing norm, then the following is true.
If II II is any increasing norm on IR n, then Ilia III

= II-<Pl(al), ... , Pn(an) '? II

However, we shall use only the 1-, 2-, oo-product norms in this book. *
The triangle inequality, the continuity of addition, and our requirements on
a product norm form a set of nearly equivalent conditions. In particular, we
make the following observation.
Lemma 4.1. If V is a normed linear space, then the operation of addition
is a bounded linear map from V X V to V.

Proof. The triangle inequality for the norm on V says exactly that addition is
bounded by 1 when the sum norm is used on V X V. 0
A normed linear space V is a (norm) direct sum EB~ Vi if the mapping
-< XI, ... , Xn '? 1---7 L~ Xi is a norm isomorphism from II~ Vi to V. That is, the
given norm on V must be equivalent to the product norm it acquires when it is
viewed as II~ Vi. If V is algebraically the direct sum EB~ Vi, we always have

by the triangle inequality for the norm on V, and the sum on the right is the onenorm for II~ Vi. Therefore, V will be the norm direct sum EB~ Vi if, conversely,
there is an n-tuple of constants {k i } such that Ilxill :-:::: kilixil for all x. This is
the same as saying that the projections Pi: X 1---7 Xi are all bounded. Thus,
Theorem 4.5. If V is a normed linear space and V is algebraically the direct
sum V = EB~ Vi, then V = EB~ Vi as normed linear spaces if and only if
the associated projections {Pi} are all bounded.

isometric surjection from the seminormed space V to the normed space V IN. An
isometry is a distance-preserving map.
5. INFINITESIMALS

The notion of an infinitesimal was abused in the early literature of the calculus,
its treatment generally amounting to logical nonsense, and the term fell into
such disrepute that many modern books avoid it completely. Nevertheless, it
is a very useful idea, and we shall base our development of the differential upon
the properties of two special classes of infinitesimals which we shall call "big oh"
and "little oh" (and designate 'e' and 'e', respectively).
Originally an infinitesimal was considered to be a number that "is infinitely
small but not zero". Of course, there is no such number. Later, an infinitesimal
was considered to be a variable that approaches zero as its limit. However, we
know that it is functions that have limits, and a variable can be considered to
have a limit only if it is somehow considered to be a function. We end up looking
at functions cp such that cp(t) ~ 0 as t ~ O. The definition of derivative involves
several such infinitesimals. If f'(x) exists and has the value a, then the fundamental difference quotient (J(x
t) - f(x)) It is the quotient of two infinitesimals, and, furthermore, (U(x
t) - f(x))lt) - a also approaches 0 as t ~ O.
This last function is not defined at 0, but we can get around this if we wish by
multiplying through by t, obtaining

+
+

(J(x

+

+ t)

- f(x)) - at

= cp(t),

wheref(x
t) - f(x) is the "change in!" infinitesimal, at is a linear infinitesimal,
and cp(t) is an infinitesimal that approaches Ofaster than t (i.e., cp(t)lt ~ 0 as t ~ 0).
If we divide the last equation by t again, we see that this property of the infin-

:t5

INFINITESIMALS

137

itesimal <p, that it converges to 0 faster than t as t -+ 0, is exactly equivalent to
the fact that the difference quotient of 1 converges to a. This makes it clear that
the study of derivatives is included in the study of the rate at which infinitesimals get small, and the usefulness of this paraphrase will shortly become clear.
Definition. A subset A of a normed linear space V is a neighborhood of a
point a if A includes some open ball about a. A deleted neighborhood of a is a

neighborhood of a minus the point a itself.
We define special sets of functions fJ, 0, and 0 as follows. It will be assumed
in these definitions that each function is from a neighborhood of 0 in a normed
linear space V to a normed linear space W.
1 E fJ if 1(0) = 0 and 1 is continuous at O. These functions are the infinitesimals.

1 E if 1(0) = 0 and 1 is Lipschitz continuous at o. That is, there exist
positive constants rand esuch that IIfW II ::; ell ~II on Br(O).

f

Eo if f(O) = 0 and Ilf(~) 11I11 ~II -+ 0 as ~ -+

o.

When the spaces V and Ware not understood, we specify them by writing
Cl(V, W), etc.
A simple set of functions from ~ to ~ makes the qualitative difference
hdween these classes apparent. The function f(x) = Ix1 1/2 is in fJ (~, ~) but not
ill 0, g(x) = x is in and therefore in fJ but not in 0, and hex) = x 2 is in all
three classes (Fig. 3.7).

°

g

f

Fig. 3.7

It is clear that fJ, 0, and 0 are unchanged when the norms on V and Ware
n·placed by equivalent norms.
Our previous notion of the sum of two functions does not apply to a pair
of functions f, g E fJ(V, W) because their domains may be different. However,
f I· g is defined on the intersection dom f n dom g, which is still a neighborhood
"I' o. Moreover, addition remains commutative and associative when extended
III this way. It is clear that then fJ(V, W) is almost a vector space.
The only
t rouble occurs in connection with the equation f + (-f) = 0; the domain of
f lin function on the left is dom f, whereas we naturally take 0 to be the zero
function on the whole of V.

138

3.5

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

* The way out of this difficulty is to identify two functions f and g in [f if
they are the same on some ball about O. We define f and g to be equivalent
(f '" g) if and only if there exists a neighborhood of 0 on whichf = g. We then
check (in our minds) that this is an equivalence relation and that we now do
have a vector space. Its elements are called germs of functions at o. Strictly
speaking, a germ is thus an equivalence class of functions, but in practice one
tends to think of germs in terms of their representing functions, only keeping in
mind that two functions are the same as germs when they agree on a neighborhood of 0.*
As one might guess from our introductory discussion, the algebraic properties of the three classes [f, e, and e are crucial for the differential calculus.
We gather them together in the following theorem.
Theorelll 5.1

c e(V, W) c [f(V, W), and each of the three classes is closed
under addition and multiplication by scalars.
If f E e(V, W), and if g E e(W, X), then g 0 f E e(V, X), where
dom g 0 f = rl[dom gJ.
If either f or g above is in e, then so is g 0 f.
If f E e(V, W) and g E [f(V, IR), then fg E e(V, W), and similarly if
f E [f and gEe.
In (4) if either for g is in e and the other is merely bounded on a neighborhood of 0, then fg E e(V, W).

some ball about O. Thenf E e if and only if f is in some £., and fEe if and only
if f is in every £.. Obviously, e C e c [f.

Ilf(O

closure of e under addition follows similarly, or simply from the limit of a

Remark. The additivity of fwas not used in this argument, only its homogeneity.
It follows therefore that there is no homogeneous function (of degree 1) in 0

Sometimes when more than one variable is present it is necessary to indicate
with respect to which variable a function is in 0 or 0. We then write ''f(~) = o(~)"
for ''I EO", where "O(~)" is used to designate an arbitrary element of o.
The following rather curious lemma will be useful later in our proof of the
differentiability of an implicitly defined function. It is understood that 71 = f(~),

6. THE DIFFERENTIAL

Before considering the notion of the differential, we shall review some geometric
material from the elementary calculus. We do this for motivation only; our subsequent theory is independent of the preliminary discussion.
In the elementary one-variable calculus the derivative f'(a) of a function f
at the point a has geometric meaning as the slope of the tangent line to the graph
of f at the point a. (Of course, according to our notion of a function, the graph
of f is f.) The tangent line thus has the (point-slope) equation y - f(a) =
f'(a)(x - a), and is the graph of the affine map x f--+ f'(a) (x - a)
f(a).
We ordinarily examine the nature of the curve f near the point < a, f(a) >by using new variables which are zero at this point. That is, we express everything in terms of s = y - f(a) and t = x-a. This change of variables is
simply the translation <x,y>- f--+ <t,s>- = <x-a,y-f(a)>- in the
Cartesian plane ~2 which brings the point of interest < a, f(a) >- to the origin.
If we picture the situation in a Euclidean plane, of which the next page is a satisfactory local model, then this translation in ~2 is represented by a choice of new
axes, the t- and s-axes, with origin at the point of tangency. Since y = f(x)

+

3.6

THE DIFFERENTIAL

+

141

if and only if 8 = f(a
t) - f(a), we see that the image of f under this translation is the function !!.fa defined by t.fo(t) = f(a
t) - f(a). (See Fig. 3.8.)
Of course, t.fa is simply our old friend the change in f brought about by changing
x from a to a
t.

Similarly, the equation y - f(a) = 1'(a)(x - a) becomes s = 1'(a)t, and
the tangent line accordingly translates to the line that is (the graph of) the
linear functional l: t f---+ .f'(a)t having the number 1'(a) as its skeleton (matrix).
Remember that from the point of view of the geometric configuration (curve and
tangent line) in the Euclidean plane, all that we are doing is choosing the natural
axis system, with origin at the point of tangency. Then the curve is (the graph
of) the function t.fa, and the tangent line is (the graph of) the linear map l.
Now it follows from the definition of 1'(a) that l can also be characterized as
Ihe linear function that approximates t.fa most closely. For, by definition,
t.fa(t) _ f'(a)

t

as

t-O,

and this is exactly the same as saying that
t.fa(t) - let) _ 0

t

or

t.fa - lEe.

But we know from the Be-theorem that the expression of the function t.fa as the
sum l e is unique. This unique linear approximation l is called the differential
of f at a and is designated dfa. Again, the differential of f at a is the linear function
I: IR f---+ IR that approximates the actual change in f, t.fa, in the sense that
tlJa - lEe; we saw above that if the derivative l' (a) exists, then the differential
of J at a exists and has f'(a) as its skeleton (1 X 1 matrix).
Similarly, if 1 is a function of two variables, then (the graph of) 1 is a surface
ill Cartesian 3-space 1R3 = 1R2 X IR, and the tangent plane to this surface at
-< a, b,l(a, b) >- has the equation z - l(a, b) = 11 Ca, b)(x - a) 12(a, b)(x - b),

and l(s, t) = s/t(a, b) + t/2(a, b), then 1l.1<a,b> is the change in I around a, b
and 1 is the linear functional on ~2 with matrix (skeleton) -</t(a, b), /2(a, b) >.
Moreover, it is a theorem of the standard calculus that if the partial derivatives
of I are continuous, then again 1 approximates 1l.1<a,b>, with error in e. Here
also 1is called the differential of I at -< a, b> and is designated dl<a,b> (Fig. 3.9).
The notation in the figure has been changed to show the value at t = -< tt, t2 >

The ee-theorem implies then that T is uniquely determined, for if also ll.Fa =
S
e, then T - SEe, and so T - S = 0 by (7) of the theorem. This uniquely
determined T is called the differential 01 F at a and is designated dFa' Thus

* Our preliminary discussion should make it clear that this definition of the
differential agrees with standard usage when the domain space is R". However,
in certain cases when the domain space is an infinite-dimensional function space,
dFa is called the first variation of F at a. This is due to the fact that although the
early writers on the calculus of variations saw its analogy with the differential
calculus, they did not realize that it was the same subject.*
We gather together in the next two theorems the familiar rules for differentiation. They follow immediately from the definition and the el9-theorem.
It will be convenient to use the notation !Da(V, W) for the set of all mappings
from neighborhoods of a in V to W that are differentiable at a.

4) If F is a constant function on V, then F is differentiable and dFa = O.
5) If F E Hom(V, W), then F is differentiable at every a E V and dFa = F.

Proof

+ 19 = e + = e by (1) and (6) of the el9-theorem.
It is clear that t:.(F + G)a = t:.Fa + i1Ga. Therefore, t:.(F + G)a =
(dFa + 0) + (dGa + 0) = (dF a + dGa) + 0 by (1) of the el9-theorem. Since
dFa + dGa E Hom(V, W), we have (2).
t:.(FG)a(~) = F(a + ~)G(a + ~) - F(a)G(a)
= t:.Fa(~)G(a) + F(a) t:.Ga(~) + t:.Fa(~) i1Ga(~),

7. DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES; THE MEAN-VALUE THEOREM

Directional derivatives form the connecting link between differentials and the
derivatives of the elementary calculus, and, although they add one more concept
that has to be fitted into the scheme of things, the reader should find them
intuitively satisfying and technically useful.
A continuous function f from an interval I C ~ to a normed linear space W
can have a derivativef'(x) at a point x E I in exactly the sense of the elementary
calculus:
f'(x)

lim f(x

+ t)

- f(x) .
t
The range of such a function f is a curve or arc in W, and it is conventional to
call f itself a parametrized arc when we want to keep this geometric notion in
mind. We shall also call f'(x), if it exists, the tangent vector to the arc f at x.
This terminology fits our geometric intuition, as Fig. 3.10 suggests. For simplicity we have set x = 0 and f(x) = O. If f'(x) exists, we say that the parametrized arc f is smooth at x. We also say that f is smooth at a = f(x), but this
terminology is ambiguous if f is not injective (i.e., if the arc crosses itself). An
arc is smooth if it is smooth at every value of the parameter.
We naturally wonder about the relationship between the existence of the
tangent vector f'(x) and the differentiability of fat x. If dfx exists, then, being a
linear map on ~, it is simply multiplication "by" the fixed vector a that is its
skeleton, dfx(h) = h dfx(1) = ha, and we expect a to be the tangent vector,

f' (x).

We showed this and also the converse result for the ordinary calculus in
our preliminary discussion in Section 6. Actually, our argument was valid for
vector-valued functions, but we shall repeat it anyway.
When we think of a vector-valued function of a real variable as being an
arc, we often use Greek letters like' 'A' and' 1" for the function, as we do below.
This of course does not in any way change what is being proved, but is slightly
suggestive of a geometric interpretation.
Theorem 7.1. A parametrized arc 1': [a, b] -+ Vis differentiable at x E (a, b)
if and only if the tangent vector (derivative) a = 'Y'(x) exists, in which case
the tangent vector is the skeleton of the differential, d'Yx(h) = h'Y'(x) = ha.

Proof. If the parametrized arc 1': [a, b] -+ V is differentiable at x E (a, b), then
d'Yx(h) = hd'Yx(1) = ha, where a = d'Yx(1). Since Ll'Yx - d'Yx E tJ, this gives
IILl'Yx(h) - hall/lhl-+ 0, and so Ll'Yx(h)/h -+ a as h -+ 0. Thus a is the derivative
'Y'(x) in the ordinary sense. By reversing the above steps we see that the existence of 1" (x) implies the differentiability of I' at x. 0
N ow let F be a function from an open set A in a normed linear space V to a
normed linear space W. One way to study the behavior of F in the neighborhood
of a point a in A is to consider how it behaves on each straight line through a.
That is, we study F by temporarily restricting it to a one-dimensional domain.
The advantage gained in doing this is that the restricted F is then simply a
parametrized arc, and its differential is simply multiplication by its ordinary
derivative.
For any nonzero ~ E V the straight line through a in the direction ~ has the
parametric representation t ....... a
t~. The restriction of F to this line is the
parametrized arc 1': 'Y(t) = F(a
t~). Its tangent vector (derivative) at the
origin t = 0, if it exists, is called the derivative of F in the direction ~ at a, or the
derivative of F with respect to ~ at a, and is designated D~F(a). Clearly,

+
+

D ~ F()
a

=

· F(a
11m

+ t~)t

- F(a)

.

t---+o

Comparing this with our original definition of 1', we see that the tangent vector
'Y'(x) to a parametrized arc I' is the directional derivative Dl'Y(X) with respect
to the standard basis vector 1 in R
Strictly speaking, we are misusing the word "direction", because different
vectors can have the same direction. Thus, if 11 = c~ with c > 0, then 11 and ~
point in the same direction, but, because DI;F(a) is linear in ~ (as we shall see in a
moment), their associated derivatives are different: D~F(a) = cDI;F(a).
We now want to establish the relationship between directional derivatives,
which are vectors, and differentials, which are linear maps. We saw above that
for an arc I' differentiability is equivalent to the existence of 'Y'(x) = Dl'Y(X).
In the general case the relationship is not as simple as it is for arcs, but in one
direction everything goes smoothly.

148

3.7

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

Theorelll 7.2. If F is differentiable at lX, and if Ais any smooth arc through lX,
with lX = A(X), then I' = F 0 A is smooth at x, and I"(x) = dFa(A'(X»).
In particular, if F is differentiable at lX, then every directional derivative
D~F(lX) exists, and D~F(lX) = dFaW.

Proof. The smoothness of I' is equivalent to its differentiability at x and therefore follows from the composite-function theorem. Moreover, I"(x) = dl'x(1) =
d(F 0 A)x(1) = dFa(dAA1») = dFa(A'(X»).
If A is the parametrized line
A(t) = lX
t~, then it has the constant derivative ~, and since lX = A(O) here,
the above formula becomes 1"(0) = dFaW.
That is, D~F(lX) = 1"(0) =
dFaW. 0

+

It is not true, conversely, that the existence of all the directional derivatives
of a function F at a point lX implies the differentiability of Fat lX. The
easiest counterexample involves the notion of a homogenous function. We say
that a function F: V -7 W is homogeneous if F(x~) = xF(~) for all x and ~.
For such a function the directional derivative D~F(O) exists because the arc
I'(t) = F(O
to = tFW is linear, and 1"(0) = F(~). Thus, all of the directional
derivatives of a homogeneous function F exist at 0 and D~F(O) = F(~). If F is
also differentiable at 0, then dFo(~) = D~F(O) = FW and F = dF o. Thus a
differentiable homogeneous function must be linear. Therefore, any nonlinear
homogeneous function F will be a function such that D~F(O) exists for all ~ but
dF o does not exist. Taking the simplest possible situation, define F: 1R2 - 7 IR by
F(x, y) = X3 /(X 2 y2) if <x, y> ~ <0,0> and F(O, 0) = O. Then
D~F(lX)

+

+

F(tx, ty)

=

tF(x, y),

so that F is homogeneous, but F is not linear.
However, if V is finite-dimensional, and if for each ~ in a spanning set of
vectors the directional derivative D~F(lX) exists and is a continuous function of lX
on an open set A, then F is continuously differentiable on A. The proof of this
fact depends on the mean-value theorem, which we take up next, but we shall
not complete it until Section 9 (Theorem 9.3).
The reader will remember the mean-value theorem as a cornerstone of the
calculus, and this is just as true in our general theory. We shall apply it in the
next section to give the proof of the general form of the above-mentioned
theorem, and practically all of our more advanced work will depend on it. The
ordinary mean-value theorem does not have an exact analogue here. Instead we
shall prove a theorem that in the one-variable calculus is an easy consequence of
the mean-value theorem.

The following more general version of the mean-value theorem is the form in
which it is ordinarily applied. As usual, F and G are from a subset of V to W.
Theorem 7.4. If F is differentiable in the ball BT(a), and if IIdFj311 ~ e for
every fJ in this ball, then 116Fj3(~)11 ~ ell ~II whenever fJ and fJ
~ are in the
ball. More generally, the same result holds if the ball BT(a) is replaced by
any convex set C.

Proof. The segment from fJ to fJ
~ is the range of the parametrized arc
X(t) = fJ
t~ from [0, 1] to V. If fJ and fJ
~ are in the ball BT(a), then this
segment is a subset of the ball. Setting 'Y(t) = F(fJ
t~), we then have 'Y'(x) =
dFj3+xE(},,'(x») = dFi3+x~(~), from Theorem 7.2. Therefore, II'Y'(x)II ~ ell~II on

which is the desired inequality. The only property of BT(a) that we have used is
that it includes the line segment joining any two of its points. This is the
definition of convexity, and the theorem is therefore true for any convex set. 0

We end this section with a few words about notation. Notice the reversal
of the positions of the variables in the identity (D~)(a) = dFa(~). This differl!IlCe has practical importance. We have a function of the two variables' a'
lI.nd ' which we can convert to a function of one variable by holding the other
variable fixed; it is convenient technically to put the fixed variable in subscript

e

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

position. Thus we think of dFa(~) with a held fixed and have the function dFa
in Hom(V, W), whereas in (D~F)(a) we hold ~ fixed and have the directional
derivative D~F: A ---t W in the fixed direction ~ as a function of a, generalizing
the notation for any ordinary partial derivative aF jaxi(a) as a function of a.
We can also express this implication of the subscript position of a variable in the
dot notation (Section 0.10): when we write D~F(a), we are thinking of the value
at a of the function D~F(·).
Still a third notation that we shall use in later chapters puts the function
symbol in subscript position. We write
J F(a)

=

dF a •

This notation implies that the mapping F is going to be fixed through a discussion
and gets it "out of the way" by putting it in subscript position.
If F is differentiable at each point of the open set A, then we naturally consider dF to be the map a ~ dF a from A to Hom(V, W). In the "J"-notation,
dF = J F. Later in this chapter we are going to consider the differentiability
of this map at a. This notion of the second differential d 2F a = d(dF)a is probably
confusing at first sight, and a preliminary look at it now may ease the later
discussion. We simply have a new map G = dF from an open set A in a normed
linear space V to a normed linear space X = Hom(V, W), and we consider its
differentiability at a. If dGa = d(dF)a exists, it is a linear map from V to
Hom(V, W), and there is something special now. Referring back to Theorem 6.1
of Chapter 1, we know that dGa = d 2 F a is equivalent by duality to a bilinear
mapping w from V X V to W: since dGa(~) is itself a transformation in
Hom(V, W), we can evaluate it at TI, and we define w by

The dot notation may be helpful here. The mapping a ~ dFa is simply
dF(.), and we have defined G by GO = dF(.). Later, the fact that dGaW is a
mapping can be emphasized by writing it as dGaa)(·). In each case here we
have a function of one variable, and the dot only reminds us of that fact and
shows us where we shall put the variable when indicating an evaluation. In the
case of w we have the original use of the dot, as in w(~, .) = dGa(~).

8. THE DIFFERENTIAL AND PRODUCT SPACES

In this section we shall relate the differentiation rules to the special configurationH
resulting from the expression of a vector space as a finite Cartesian product.
When dealing with the range, this is a trivial consideration, but when the domain
is a product space, we become involved with a deeper theorem. These general
product considerations will be specialized to the IRn-spaces in the next section,
but they also have a more general usefulness, as we shall see in the later sectionH
of this chapter and in later chapters.
We know that an m-tuple of functions on a common domain, Fi: A ~ Wi,
i = 1, ... , m, is equivalent to a single m-tuple-valued function
m

F: A ~ W

=

II Wi,

F(OI) being the m-tuple {F i (OI)}T for each a E A. We now check the obviously
necessary fact that F is differentiable at a if and only if each Fi is differentiable

at

01.

1, ... , m, and F = -< FI, ... ,Fm >-,
then F is differentiable at a if and only if all the functions Fi are, in which
case dF", = -< dF!, ... , dF':: >-.

TheoreDl 8.1. Given Fi: A ~ Wi, i =

Proof. Strictly speaking, F = LT 8i 0 F i , where 8j is the injection of W j into
the product space W = lIT Wi (see Section 1.3). Since each 8i is linear and
hence differentiable, with d(8 i )", = 8i, we see that if each Fi is differentiable at 01,
then so is F, and dF", = LT 8i 0 dF~. Less exactly, this is the statement
dF", = -<dF!, ... , dF'::>-. The converse follows similarly from Fi = 7ri 0 F,
where 7rj is the projection of lIT Wi onto Wj. D
Theorems 7.1 and 8.1 have the following obvious corollary (which can also
be proved as easily by a direct inspection of the limits involved) ..
LeDlDla 8.1. If f; is an arc from [a, b] to Wi, for i = 1, ... , n, and if f i~
the n-tuple-valued arc f = -<iI,.·., fn >-, then f'(x) exists if and only if
fI (x) exists for each i, in which case f'(x) = -<f~ (x), ... ,f~(x) >-.

When the domain space V is a product space lI~ V j the situation is morl'
complicated. A function F(h, ... , ~n) of n vector variables does not decomposl'

a.s

153

THE DIFFERENTIAL AND PRODUCT SPACES

into an equivalent n-tuple of functions. Moreover, although its differential
liFo. does decompose into an equivalent n-tuple of partial differentials {dF~},
we do not have the simple theorem that dFa. exists if and only if the partial
differentials dF~ all exist.
Of course, we regard a function F(h, ... , ~n) of n vector variables as being
a function of the single n-tuple variable ~ = < h, ... , ~n >-, so that in principle
t.here is nothing new when we consider the differentiability of F. However, when
we consider a composition FoG, the inner function G must now be an n-tuplevalued function G = <gl, ... , gn >-, where gi is from an open subset A of some
normed linear space X to Vi, and we naturally try to express the differential
of FoG in terms of the differentials dgi. To accomplish this we need the partial
differentials dF~ of F. For the moment we shall define the jth partial differential
of F at a = < ai, ... , a n >- as the restriction of the differential dF a. to Vj,
(~onsidered as a subspace of V =
Vi. As usual, this really involves the
injection OJ of Vj into II? Vi, and our formal (temporary) definition, accordingly,

That is, dF~ is the differential at ai of the function of the one variable ~i
oht.ained by holding the other variables in F(h, ... , ~n) fixed at the values
Ei = aj. This is important because in practice it is often such partial differenI ill.bility that we come upon as the primary phenomenon. We shall therefore
luke this direct characterization as our definition of dF~, after which our moti\'lLting calculation above is the proof of the following lemma.
Lemma 8.2. If A is an open subset of a product space V = II? Vi, and if
F: A - 7 W is differentiable at a, then all the partial differentials dF~ exist
and dF~ = dF a. 0 Oi'

154

3.8

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

The question then occurs as to whether the existence of all the partial
differentials dF~ implies the existence of dF a.. The answer in general is negative,
as we shall see in the next section, but if all the partial differentials dF~ exist for
each a in an open set A and are continuous functions of a, then F is continuously
differentiable on A. Note that Lemma 8.2 and the projection-injection identities
show us what dFa. must be if it exists: dF~ = dFa. 0 8 i and L 8i 0 'Tri = I together
imply that dFa. = L dF~ 0 'Tri.
Theorem 8.2. Let A be an open subset of the normed linear space
V = VI X V 2, and suppose that F: A ~ W has continuous partial differentials dF~a.f3> and dF~a.f3> on A. Then dF <a.f3> exists and is continuous
on A, and dF <a.f3>(~, 7]) = dF~a.f3>(~) + dF~a.f3>(7]).
Proof. We shall use the sum norm on V = VI X V 2. Given E, we choose aso
that I/dFi<J.'.v> - dF i<a.f3> I < E for every <'J.t, v>- in the a-ball about <'a, {3>and for i = 1, 2. Setting

The theorem for more than two factor spaces is a corollary.

continuous as a function of a = <. a 1> ••• , an >-, then dF a. exists and is

to add dF! to this sum partial differential, concluding that L ~ dF~ 0 7r i is the
partial differential of F on the factor space VI X V 2 X V 3, and so on (which is
colloquial for induction). 0
As an illustration of the use of these two theorems, we shall deduce the
general product rule (although a direct proof based on .1-estimates is perfectly
feasible). A general product is simply a bounded bilinear mapping w: X X Y ---t W,
where X, Y, and Ware all normed linear spaces. The boundedness inequality
here is "w(~, 7/)11 ~ bll ~11117/11.

dW~a.{J> = g{J is a continuous function of -< a, (3 '?
Similarly, dW~a.{J>(7/) =
w(a, 7/), and dw 2 is continuous. The lemma is now a direct corollary of Theorem

general vector space V, the partial derivatives now being vectors.

9. THE DIFFERENTIAL AND IRn

We shall now apply the results of the last two sections to mappings involving the
Cartesian spaces IR n , the bread and butter spaces of finite-dimensional theory.
We start with the domain.
Theorem 9.1. If F is a mapping from (an open subset of) IRn to a normed
linear space W, then the directional derivative of F in the direction of the .ith
standard basis vector ~j is just the partial derivative aF/ ax;, and the .ith
partial differential is multiplication by aF /aXj: dF~(h) = h(aF /aXj) (a).
More exactly, if anyone of the above three objects exists at a, then they
all do, with the above relationships.

Moreover, since the restriction of F to a + lR~j is a parametrized arc whose
differential at 0 is by definition the jth partial differential of F at a and whose
tangent vector at 0 we have just computed to be (aFjaxj)(a), the remainder of
the theorem follows from Theorem 7.1. 0
Combining this theorem and Theorem 7.2, we obtain the following result.
Theorelll 9.2. If V = IRn and F is differentiable at a, then the partial
derivatives (aF jaXj) (a) all exist and the n-tuple of partial derivatives at
a, {(aFjaxj)(a))~, is the skeleton of dF a. In particular,

All that we have done here is to display dF a as the linear combination mapping
defined by its skeleton {dFa(~i)} (see Theorem 1.2 of Chapter 1), where T(~i) =
tlFa(~i) is now recognized as the partial derivative (aFjaXi)(a). 0
The above formula shows the barbarism of the classical notation for partial
Ilcrivatives: note how it comes out if we try to evaluate dFa(x). The notation
[)aiF is precise but cumbersome. Other notations are F j and DjF. Each has its
problems, but the second probably minimizes the difficulties. Using it, our
formula reads dFa(Y) = L:J=1 yjDjF(a).
In the opposite direction we have the corresponding specialization of
Theorem 8.3.
Theorelll 9.3. If A is an open subset of IRn, and if F is a mapping from A

to a normed linear space W such that all of the \ partial derivatives
(aF jaXj) (a) exist and are continuous on A, then F is continuously differentiable on A.
Proof. Since the jth partial differential of F is simply multiplication by aF j aXil
we are (by Theorem 9.1) assuming the existence and continuity of all the partial
differentials dF~ on A. Theorem 9.3 thus becomes a special case of Theorem 8.3. 0

N ow suppose that the range space of F is also a Cartesian space, so that F
is a mapping from an open subset A of IR n to IRm. Then dF a is in Hom(lR n, IRm).

158

3.9

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

For computational purposes we want to represent linear maps from IRn to IR'"
by their matrices, and it is therefore of the utmost importance to find the matrix
t of the differential T = dF a' This matrix is called the Jacobian matrix of F
at a.
The columns of t form the skeleton of dF a, and we saw above that this
skeleton is the n-tuple of partial derivatives (aF /aXj) (a). If we write the mtuple-valued F loosely as an m-tuple of functions, F = -<!11""!m >-, then
according to Lemma 8.1, the jth column of t is the m-tuple

aF
a-Xj (a)

=

Thus,

F be a mapping from an open subset of IR n to IRm, and
suppose that F is differentiable at a. Then the matrix of dFa (the Jacobian
matrix of F at a) is given by

Theorelll 9.4. Let

If we use the notation Yi = /i(x), we have

If we also have a differentiable map z = G(y) = -< gl (y), ... , gl(y)

This is the usual form of the chain rule in the calculus. We see that it is merely
the expression of the composition of linear maps as matrix multiplication.
We saw in Section 8 that the ordinary derivativef'(a) of a function! of one
real variable is the skeleton of the differential d!a, and it is perfectly reasonable to
generalize this relationship and define the derivative F'(a) of a function F of
n real variables to be the skeleton of dFa , so that F'(a) is the n-tuple of partial
derivatives {(aF /aXi) (a)H, as we saw above. In particular, if F is from an open
subset of IR n to IR m, then F'(a) is the Jacobian matrix of F at a. This gives the

However, we shall stay with the language of Jacobians.
Suppose now that A is an open subset of a finite-dimensional vector space V
and that H: A ~ W is differentiable at a E A. Suppose that W is also finitedimensional and that cp: V ~ IR n and 1/;: W ~ IRm are any coordinate isomorphisms. If A = cp[A], then A is an open subset of IRn and H = 1/; 0 H 0 cp-l is a

10. ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS

The elementary max-min theory from the standard calculus generalizes with
little change, and we include a brief discussion of it at this point.
TheoreDl 10.1. Let F be a real-valued function defined on an open subset A
of a normed linear space V, and suppose that F assumes a relative maximum
value at a point a in A where dFa exists. Then dF a = O.

Proof. By definition D~F(a) is the derivative 'Y'(O) of the function 'Y(t) =
F(a
t~), and the domain of'Y is a neighborhood of 0 in R Since'Y has a relative
maximum value at 0, we have 'Y'(O) = 0 by the elementary calculus. Thus
dFa(~) = D~F(a) = 0 for all ~, and so dF a = O. 0

+

A point a such that dFa = 0 is called a critical point. The theorem states
that a differentiable real-valued function can have an interior extremal value
only at a critical point.
If V is IRn, then the above argument shows that a real-valued function F
can have a relative maximum (or minimum) at a only if the partial derivatives
(aF/aXi)(a) are all zero, and, as in the elementary calculus, this often provides
a way of calculating maximum (or minimum) values. Suppose, for example,
that we want to show that the cube is the most efficient rectangular parallelepiped
from the point of view of minimizing surface area for a given volume V. If
the edges are x, y and z, we have V = xyz and A = 2(xy + xz + yz) =
2(xy + V/y + V/x). Then from 0 = aAjax = 2(y - V/x 2), we see that
V = yx 2, and, similarly, aA/ay = 0 implies that V = xy2. Therefore, yx 2 =
xy2, and since neither x nor y can be 0, it follows that x = y. Then V = yx 2 =
x 3 , and x = V I /3 = y. Finally, substituting in V = xyz shows that z = V I /3.
Our critical configuration is thus a cube, with minimum area A = 6V 2 /3.
It was assumed above that A has an absolute minimum at some point
-< x, y, z >-. The reader might enjoy showing that A ~ 00 if any of x, y, z tends
to 0 or 00, which implies that the minimum does indeed exist.
We shall return to the problem of determining critical points in Sections
12, 15, and 16.
The condition dFa = 0 is necessary but not sufficient for an interior maximum or mmimum. The reader will remember a sufficient condition from
beginning calculus: If f'(x) = 0 and f"(x) < 0 (>0), then x is a relative maximum (minimum) point for f. We shall prove the corresponding general theorem
in Section 16. There are more possibilities now; among them we have the
analogous sufficient condition that if dFa = 0 and d 2F a is negative (positive)
definite as a quadratic form on V, then a is a relative maximum (minimum)
point of F.
We consider next the notion of a tangent plane to a graph. The calculation
of tangent lines to curves and tangent planes to surfaces is ordinarily considered
a geometric application of the derivative, and we take this as sufficient justification for considering the general question here.

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

Let F be a mapping from an open subset A of a normed linear space V to
a normed linear space W. When we view F as a graph in V X W, we think of it
as a "surface" S lying "over" the domain A, generalizing the geometric interpretation of the graph of a real-valued function of two real variables in 1R3 = 1R2 X IR.
The projection 11'1: V X W ~ V projects S "down" onto A,

-< ~, F(~) >- t;rt

~,

and the mapping ~ 1---+ -<~, F(~) >- gives the point of S lying "over"~. Our
geometric imagery views V as the plane (subspace) V X {O} in V X W, just as
we customarily visualize IR as the real axis IR X {O} in 1R2.
We now assume that F is differentiable at a. Our preliminary discussion in
Section 6 suggested that (the graph of) the linear function dF a is the tangent
plane to (the graph of) the function IlFa in V X W, and that its translate M
through -< a, F(a) >- is the tangent plane at -< a, F(a) >- to the surface S that is
(the graph of) F. The equation of this plane is TJ - F(a) = dFa(~ - a), and
it is accordingly (the graph of) the affine function GW = dFa(~ - a)
F(a).
Now we know that dFa is the unique T in Hom(V, W) such that IlFa(!;) =
T(r)
('J(r), and if we set r = ~ - a, it is easy to see that this is the same as
saying that G is the unique affine map from V to W such that

+

+

F(~)

G(~) =

-

('J(~

- a).

That is, M is the unique plane over V that "fits" the surface S around -< a, F(a) >in the sense of ('J-approximation.
However, there is one further geometric fact that greatly strengthens our
feeling that this really is the tangent plane.
Theorem 10.2. The plane with equation TJ - F(a) = dFa(~ - a) is
exactly the union of all the straight lines through -< a, F(a) >- in V X W
that are tangent to smooth curves on the surface S = graph F passing
through this point. In other words, the vectors in the subspace dFa of
V X Ware exactly the tangent vectors to curves lying in S and passing
through -< a, F(a) >-.

tangent vector at -< a, F(a) >-, by Lemma 8.1 and Theorem 8.2.
Conversely, if t 1---+ -< X(t), F (X(t») >- is any smooth arc in S passing through a,
with a = X(to), then its tangent vector at -< a, F(a) >- is

-< X' (to), dFa (X' (to») >- ,
a vector in (the graph of) dFa. 0

ll. THE IMPLICIT-FUNCTION THEOREM

The formula for the Jacobian of a composite map that we obtained in Section \)
is reminiscent of the chain rule for the differential of a composite map that we
derived earlier (Section 8). The Jacobian formula involves numbers (partial
derivatives) that we multiply and add; the differential chain rule involves linear
maps (partial differentials) that we compose and add. (The similarity becomes
a full formal analogy if we use block decompositions.) Roughly speaking, the

3.11

THE IMPLICIT-FUNCTW:>i THEOREM

165

whole differential calculus goes this way. In the one-variable calculus a differential is a linear map from the one-dimensional space IR to itself, and is therefore
multiplication by a number, the derivative. In the many-variable calculus when
we decompose with respect to one-dimensional subspaces, we get blocks of such
numbers, i.e., Jacobian matrices. When we generalize the whole theory to vector
spaces that are not one-dimensional, we get essentially the same formulas but
with numbers replaced by linear maps (differentials) and multiplication by
composition.
Thus the derivative of an inverse function is the reciprocal of the derivative
1 and b = f(a), then g'(b) = l/f'(a). The differential
of the function: if 9 =
of an inverse map is the composition inverse of the differential of the map: if
G = F- 1 and F(a) = {3, then dG{3 = (dFa)-l.
If the equation g(x, y) =
defines y implicitly as a function of x, y = f(x),
we learn to compute f'(a) in the elementary calculus by differentiating

We shall see below that if G(~, 7)) = defines 7) as a function of ~, 7) = F(~),
and if (3 = F(a), then we calculate the differential dF a by differentiating the
identity G(~, F(~)) = 0, and we get a formula formally identical to the above.
Finally, in exactly the same way, the so-called auxiliary variable method of
solving max-min problems in the elementary calculus has the same formal
structure as our later solution of a "constrained" maximum problem by Lagrange
multipliers.
In this section we shall consider the existence and differentiability of functions implicitly defined. Suppose that we are given a (vector-valued) function
G(~, 7)) of two vector variables, and we want to know whether setting G equal
to defines 7) as a function of ~, that is, whether there exists a unique function F
such that G (~, F(~)) is identically zero. Supposing that such an "implicitly
defined" function F exists and that everything is differentiable, we can try
to compute the differential of F at a by differentiating the equation G(~, F(~)) =
0, or Go <.1, F'? = 0. We get dG~a,B> 0 dl a
dG~a,{3> 0 dF a = 0, where we
have set (3 = F(a). If dG 2 is invertible, we can solve for dF a, getting

Note that this has the same form as the corresponding expression from the
elementary calculus that we reviewed above. If F is uniquely determined, then
so is elF a, and the above calculation therefore strongly suggests that we are

166

3.11

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

going to need the existence of (dG~a,tJ»-1 as a necessary condition for the
existence of a uniquely defined implicit function around the point -< a, (3 > .
Since (3 is F(a), we also need G(a,
= O. These considerations will lead us to
the right theorem, but we shall have to postpone part of its proof to the next
chapter. What we can prove here is that if there is an implicitly defined function,
then it must be differentiable.

Theorem 11.1. Let V, W, and X be normed linear spaces, and let G be a
mapping from an open subset A X B of V X W to X. Suppose that F is a continuous mapping from A to B implicitly defined by the equation G(~, 1/) = 0,
that is, satisfying G(~, F(~)) = 0 on A. Finally, suppose that G is differentiable at -< a, (3 >, where (3 = F(a), and that dG~a,tJ> is invertible. Then
F is differentiable at a and dFa = -(dG~a,tJ»-1 0 dG~a,tJ>.

+ O(e( -<~, 1/> )).

+

This equation is of the form 1/ = O(~)
e( -< ~, 1/ > ), and since 1/ = dF a(~) is
an infinitesimal 9'(~), by the continuity of F at a, Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2 imply
first that 1/ = O(~) and then that -<~, 1/> = O(~). Thus O(e(-<~, 1/») =
e(eO(m) = ea), and we have

where 8 = -(dG~a,tJ»-1 0 dG~a,tJ>' an element of Hom(V, W). Therefore, F
is differentiable at a and dF a has the asserted value. 0
We shall show in the next chapter, as an application of the fixed-point
theorem, that if V, W, and X are finite-dimensional, and if G is a continuously
differentiable mapping from an open subset A X B of V X W to X such that
at the point -<a, (3) we have both G(a, (3) = 0 and dG~a,tJ> invertible, then
there is a uniquely determined continuous mapping F from a neighborhood M of
a to B such that F(a) = (3 and G(~, F(~)) = 0 on M. The same theorem is true
for the more general class of complete normed linear spaces which we shall study
in the next chapter. For these spaces it is also true that if T- l exists, then so
does 8-1 for all 8 sufficiently close to T, and the mapping 81--+8- 1 is continuous. Therefore dG~p.,.> is invertible for all -<fJ., v> sufficiently close to
-< a, (3 >, and the above theorem then implies that F is differentiable on a
neighborhood of a. Moreover, only continuous mappings are involved in the
formula given by the theorem for dF: fJ. 1--+ dFp., and it follows that F is in fact
continuously differentiable near a. These conclusions constitute the implicitfunction theorem, which we now restate.

12. SUBMANIFOLDS AND LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS

If V and Ware finite-dimensional spaces, with dimensions nand m, respectively,
and if F is a continuous mapping from an open subset A of V to W, then (the
graph of) F is a subset of V X W which we visualize as a kind of "n-dimensional
surface" S spread out over A. (See Section 10.) We shall call F an n-dimensional
patch in V X W. :\Iore generally, if X is any (n
m)-dimensional vector space,
we shall call a subset S an n-dimensional patch if there is an isomorphism 'P
from X to a product space V X W such that V is n-dimensional and 'P[S] is a
patch in V X W. That is, S becomes a patch in the above sense when X is
considered to be V X W. This means that if 11"1 is the projection of X = V X W

+

r

onto V, then 1I"dS] is an open subset A of V, and the restriction 11"1 S is one-toone and has a continuous inverse. If 11"2 is the projection on W, then F =
11"2 a (11"1
S)-I~ is the map from A to W whose graph in V X W is S (when
V X W is identified with X).
N ow there are important surfaces that aren't such "patch" surfaces. Consider, for instance, the surface of the unit ball in ~3, S = {x : L~ x 2 = I}. S is
obviously a two-dimensional surface in ~3 which cannot be expressed as a graph,
no matter how we try to express ~3 as a direct sum. However, it should be
equally clear that S is the union of overlapping surface patches. If a is any point
on S, then any sufficiently small neighborhood N of a in ~3 will intersect S in a
patch; we take Vas the subspace parallel to the tangent plane at a and Was
the perpendicular line through O. Moreover, this property of S is a completely
adequate definition of what we mean by a submanifold.
A subset S of an (n + m)-dimensional vector space X is an n-dimensional
submanifold of X if each a on S has a neighborhood N in X whose intersection
with S is an n-dimensional patch.
We say that S is smooth if all these patches Sa are smooth, that is, if the
function F: A ---? W whose graph in V X W is the patch Sa (when X is viewed
as V X W) is continuously differentiable for every such patch Sa.
The sphere we considered above is a two-dimensional smooth submanifold
of ~3.
Submanifolds are frequently presented as zero sets of mappings. For
example, our sphere above is the zero set of the mapping G from ~3 to ~ defined
by G(x) = L~ xl - 1. It is obviously important to have a condition guaranteeing that such a null set is a submanifold.

Theorem 12.1. Let G be a continuously differentiable mapping from an open
subset U of an (n + m)-dimensional vector space X to an m-dimensional
vector space Y such that dGa is surjective for every a in the zero set S of G.
Then S is an n-dimensional submanifold of X.

Proof. Choose any point 'Y of S. Since dG-y is surjective from the (n + m)dimensional vector space X to the m-dimensional vector space Y, we know that
the null space V of dG-y has dimension n (Theorem 2.4, Chapter 2). Let W be any

3.12

SUBMANIFOLDS AND LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS

complement of V, and think of X as V X W, so that G now becomes a function of
two vector variables and 'Y is a point <a, /3 >- such that G(a, /3) = O. The
restriction of dG <a.,fJ> to W is an isomorphism from W to Y; that is, (dG~a.,fJ»-l
exists. Therefore, by the implicit-function theorem, there is a product neighborhood Sa(a) X Sr(/3) of < a, /3 >- in X whose intersection with S is the graph
of a function on Sa(a). This proves our theorem. 0
If S is a smooth submanifold, then the function F whose graph is the patch
of S around 'Y (when X is viewed suitably as V X W) is continuously differentiable, and therefore S has a uniquely determined n-dimensional tangent plane M
at 'Y that fits S most closely around 'Y in the sense of our l'J-approximations.
If 'Y = 0, this tangent plane is an n-dimensional subspace, and in general it is
the translate through 'Y of a subspace N. We call N t.he tangent space of S at 'Y;
its elements are exactly the vectors in X tangent to parametrized arcs drawn
in S through 'Y. What we are going to do later is to describe an n-dimensional
manifold S independently of any imbedding of S in a vector space. The tangent
space to S at a point 'Y will still be an invaluable notion, but we are not going to
he able to visualize it by an actual tangent plane in a space X carrying S.
Instead, we will have to construct the vector space tangent to S at 'Y somehow.
The clue is provided by Theorem 10.2, which tells us that if S is imbedded
I1S a submanifold in a vector space X, then each vector tangent to S at 'Y can be
presented as the unique tangent vector at 'Y to some smooth curve lying in S.
This mapping from the set of smooth curves in S through 'Y to the tangent space
Itt'Y is not injective; clearly, different curves can be tangent to each other at 'Y
ILlld so have the same tangent vector there. Therefore, the object in S that
eorresponds to a tangent vector at 'Y is an equivalence class of smooth curves
through 'Y, and this will in fact be our definition of a tangent vector for a general
lIIanifold.
The notion of a submanifold allows us to consider in an elegant way a
<:Iassical "constrained" maximum problem. Weare given an open subset U
of a finite-dimensional vector space X, a differentiable real-valued function F
defined on U, and a submanifold S lying in U. We shall suppose that the
,ubmanifold S is the zero set of a continuously differentiable mapping G from U
10 a vector space Y such that dG"( is surjective for each 'Y on S. We wish to
('lIllsider the problem of maximizing (or minimizing) F('Y) when 'Y is "conHtrained" to lie on S. We cannot expect to find such a maximum point 'Yo by
Hd,ting dF"( = 0 and solving for 'Y, because 'Yo will not be a critical point for F.
(:ollsider, for example, the function fI(x) = L~ xT - 1 from ~3 to ~ and F(x) =
.1'2' Here the "surface" defined by fI = 0 is the unit sphere L~ xT = 1, and on
Ihis sphere F has its maximum value 1 at <0,1,0>-. But F is linear, and so
,[/,,"( = F can never be the zero transformation. The device known as Lagrange
multipliers shows that we can nevertheless find such constrained critical points
by solving dL,,( = 0 for a suitable function L.

Proof. By the implicit-function theorem we can express X as V X W in such a
way that the neighborhood of S around I' is the graph of a mapping H from an
open set A in V to W. Thus, expressing F and G as functions on V X W, we
have G(~, 1/) = 0 near I' = «a, (3) if and only if 1/ = H(~), and the restriction
of F(~, 1/) to this zero surface is thus the function K: A ~ IR defined by Ka) =

Let l E y* be the functional dF 2 0 (dG 2 )-I. Then we have dF I = lo dG I and,
by definition, dF 2 = lo dG 2 • Composing the first equation (on the right) with
1rl: V X W ~ V and the second with 1r2, and adding, we get dF <a,p> =
lo dG<a,p>. That is, d(F - lo Gh = o. 0
Nothing we have said so far explains the phrase "Lagrange mUltipliers".
This comes out of the Cartesian expression of the theorem, where we have U
an open subset of a Cartesian space IR n, Y = IR m , G = « gl, ... , gm> , and l ill

want to maximize F(x) = X2 from 1R3 to IR subject to the constraint L~ x'f = 1.
Here g(x) = L~ x'f - 1 is also from 1R3 to IR, and our method tells us to look

*13. FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCE

The question, roughly, is this: If we are given a collection of continuous functions,
all defined on some open set A, how can we tell whether or not some of them are
functions of the rest? For example, if we are given three real-valued continuous
functions fll 12, and fa, how can we tell whether or not some one of them is a
function of the other two, say fa is a function offl and12, which means that there
is a function of two variables g(x, y) such that fa(t) = g(!I (t), f2(t)) for all t in
the common domain A? If this happens, we say that fa is functionally dependent
on !I and f2. This is very nearly the same as asking when it will be the case that
the range S of the mapping F: t ~ <'!I(t),!2(t), fa(t) >- is a two-dimensional
submanifold of IRa. However, there are differences in these questions that are
worth noting. If fa is functionally dependent on fl and f2' then the range of F
certainly lies on a two-dimensional submanifold of IRa, namely, the graph of g.
But this is no guarantee that it itself forms a two-dimensional submanifold.
For example, both 12 and fa might be functionally dependent on !I, f2 = go fl'
and fa = h 0!I, in which case the range of F lies on the curve <. s, g(s), h(s) >- in
IRa, which is a one-dimensional submanifold. In the opposite direction, the range
of F can be a two-dimensional submanifold M without fa being functionally
dependent onf2 and fl. All we can conclude in this case is that locally one of the
functions {h} ~ is a function of the other two, since locally M is a surface patch,
in the language of the last section. But if we move a little bit away on the
eurving surface M to the neighborhood of another point, we may have to solve
for a different one of the functions. Nevertheless, if M = range F is a subset of
u two-dimensional manifold, it is reasonable to say that the functions {h} ~ are
functionally dependent, and we are led to examine this more natural notion.

3.1:~

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

If we assume that F = -<ft, f2' fa >- is continuously differentiable and that
the rank of dF a is 3 at some point a in A, then the implicit-function theorem
implies that F[A] includes a whole ball in 1R3 about the point F(a). Thus a
necessary condition for !If = range F to lie on a two-dimensional submanifold in
1R3 is that the rank of dF a be everywhere less than 3. We shall see, in fact, that
if the rank of dFa is 2 for all a, then lIf = range F is essentially a two-dimensional
manifold. (There is still a tiny difficulty that we shall explain later.) Our tools
are going to be the implicit-function theorem and the following theorem, which
could well have come much earlier, that the rank of T is a "lower semi continuous" function of T.

V and W be finite-dimensional vector spaces, normed
in some way. Then for any Tin Hom(V, W) there is an E such that

bounded below by some positive m. (I ts inverse from R to X is bounded by
some b, by Theorem 4.2, and we set m = l/b.) Then if liS - Til < m/2, it
follows that S is bounded below on X by m/2, for the inequalities

so rank S = derange S) ~ d(X) = d(R) = rank T. D
We can now prove the general local theorem.
Theorelll 13.2. Let V and W be finite-dimensional spaces, let l' be an integer
less than the dimension of W, and let F be a continuously differentiable map
from an open subset A C V to W such that the rank of dF-y = r for all 'Y
in A. Then each point 'Y in A has a neighborhood U such that F[U] is an
r-dimensional patch submanifold of W.

Proof. For a fixed 'Y in A let VIand Y be the null space and range of dF-y, let
V 2 be a complement of VI in V, and view V as VI X V 2. Then F becomes
a function F(~, 71) of two variables, and if 'Y = -<a, f3>-, then dF~a,{J> is an
isomorphism from V 2 to Y. At this point we can already choose the decomposition W = WI Et> W 2 with respect to which F[A] is going to be a graph
(locally). We simply choose any direct sum decomposition W = WI Et> W 2
such that W 2 is a complement of Y = range dF <a,{J>' Thus WI might be Y,
but it doesn't have to be. Let P be the projection of W onto W b along W 2.
Since Y is a complement of the null space of P, we know that PlY is an
isomorphism from Y to WI. In particular, WI is r-dimensional, and

neighborhood of < a, (3 >-. On the other hand, the range of P 0 dF <~,~> is
included in the range of P, which is WI, and so rank P 0 dF <~,~> ~ r. Thus
rank po dF <~,'1> = r for <~, 71>- near <a, (3)-, and since rank dF <~,~> = r

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

Since F1[U] = P 0 F[U] = L, the above equation says that F[U] is the graph of
the mapping k from L to W 2. Moreover, L is an open subset of the r-dimensional
vector space W 1, and therefore F[U] is an r-dimensional patch manifold in
W = W 1 X W 2• 0

The above theorem includes the answer to our original question about
functional dependence.
Corollary. Let F = {fi}i be an m-tuple of continuously differentiable
real-valued functions defined on an open subset A of a normed linear space
V, and suppose that the rank of dFa has the constant value r on A, where r
is less than m. Then any point 'Y in A has a neighborhood U over which
m - r of the functions are functionally dependent on the remaining r.
Proof. By hypothesis the range Y of dF'Y = -<df~, ... , df!7> is an r-dimensional subspace of IRm. We can therefore find a basis for a complementary subspace W 2 by choosing m - r of the standard basis elements {6 i }, and we may
as well renumber the functions so that these are 6 +1 , ••• ,6m • Then the
projection P of IR m onto W = L(6 1, ••• , 6T ) is an isomorphism from Y to W
(since Y is a complement of its null space), and by the theorem there is a neighborhood U of 'Y over which (l - P) 0 F is a function k of po F. But this says
exactly that -<r+1, ... ,r> = k 0 -<fl, ... ,r>. That is, k is an (m - r)tuple-valued function, k = -<kr+t, ... , k m >, and fi = ki 0 -<ft, ... ,F> for
j = r + 1, ... ,m. 0

We mentioned earlier in the section that there was a difficulty in concluding
that if F is a continuously differentiable map from an open subset A of V to W
whose differential has constant rank r less than deW), then S = range F is an
r-dimensional submanifold of S. The flaw can be described as follows. The
definition of a submanifold S of X required that each point of S have a neighborhood in X whose intersection with S is a patch. In the case before us, what we

3.14

179

can conclude is that if fl is a point of S, then fl = F(at.) for some at. in A, and at.
has a neighborhood U whose image under F is a patch. But this image may not
be a full neighborhood of fl in S, because S may curve back on itself in such a
way as to intrude into every neighborhood of fl. Consider, for example, the onedimensional r imbedded in 1R3 suggested by following Fig. 3.12. The curve
begins in the xz-plane along the z-axis, curves over, and when it comes to the
xy-plane it starts spiraling in to the origin in the xy-plane (the point of change
over from the xz-plane to the xy-plane is a singularity that we could smooth out).
The origin is not a point having a neighborhood in 1R3 whose intersection with r
is a one-patch, but the full curve is the image of (-1, 1) under a continuously
differentiable injection.
We would consider r to be a one-dimensional manifold without any difficulty,
but something has gone wrong with its imbedding in 1R 3 , so it is not a one-dimensional submanifold of 1R3.
*14. UNIFORM CONTINUITY AND FUNCTION-VALUED MAPPINGS

In the next chapter we shall see that a continuous function F whose domain is a
bounded closed subset of a finite-dimensional vector space V is necessarily
uniformly continuous. This means that given E, there is a ~ such that
I!~

for all vectors ~ and 'I in the domain of F.
The point is that 8 depends only on E and not, as in ordinary continuity,
on the "anchor" point at which continuity is being asserted. This is a very
important property. In this section we shall see that it underlies a class of
theorems in which a point map is escalated to a function-valued map, and properties of the point map imply corresponding properties of the function-valued
map. Such theorems have powerful applications, as we shall see in Section 15
and in Section 1 of Chapter 6. An application that we shall get immediately here
is the theorem on differentIation under the integral sign. However, it is only
Theorem 14.3 that will be used later in the book.
Suppose first that Fa, 'I) is a bounded continuous function from a product
open set M X N to a normed linear space X. Holding 'I fixed, we have a function
I.(E) = F(~, 'I) which is a bounded continuous function on M, that is, an
~Iement of the normed linear space Y = me(M, X) of all bounded continuous
maps from M to X. This function is also indicated F( . , 'I), so that f~ = F( . , 'I)'
We are supposing that the uniform norm is being used on Y:
IIf~1I

lub {lIf'l(~)1I : ~ E M}

=

lub {IIF(~, '1)11 : ~ EM}.

Theorem 14.1. In the above context, if F is unt"formly continuous, then the

mapping 'I 1-+ f'l (or 'I

We have proved that if a function of two variables is uniformly continuous,
then the mappings obtained from it by the general duality principle are continuous. This phenomenon lies behind many well-known facts. For example:
Corollary. If F(x, y) is a uniformly continuous real-valued function on the
unit square [0, 11 X [0, 11 in ~2, then
F(x, y) dx is a continuous function

U

of y.

IJ

Proof. The mapping y ~
F(x, y) dx is the composition of the bounded
linear mapping f ~
f from e([O, 11 to ~ with the continuous mapping
y ~ F( . , y) from [0, 1] to e[O, 1], and is continuous as the composition of continuous mappings. 0

IJ

We consider next the differentiability of the above duality-induced mapping.
Theorelll 14.2. If F is a bounded continuous mapping from an open product
set M X N of a normed linear space V X W to a normed linear space X,
and if dJi'~a.fJ> exists and is a bounded uniformly continuous function of
-<a, fJ>- on M X N, then cP: 1] ~ F(·, 1]) is a differentiable mapping from
N to Y = CBe(M, X), and [dcpfJ(1])]W = dF~~.fJ>(1]).

This says exactly that the mapping cP is differentiable at (3 and dcp/l

=

T. 0

The mapping cP is in fact continuously differentiable, as can be seen by
arguing a little further in the above manner. The situation is very close to being
an application of Theorem 14.1.
The classical theorem on differentiability under the integral sign is a corollary
of the above theorem. We give a simple case. Note that if 71 is a real variable y,
then the above formula for dcp can be rewritten in terms of arc derivatives:
[cp'(b)]W

= ~~ (~, b).

Corollary. If F(x, y) is a continuous real-valued function on the unit
square [0, 1] X [0, 1], and if aF jay exists and is a uniformly continuous
function on the square, then U F(x, y) dx is a differentiable function of y
and its derivative is U (aFjay) (x, y) dx.

Proof. The mapping T: y f-+ U F(x, y) dx is the composition of the bounded
linear mappingf f-+ U f(x) dx from e([O, 1]) to IR with the differentiable mapping
cp: y f-+ F( . ,y) from [0, 1] to e([O, 1]), and is therefore differentiable by the
composite-function rule. Then Theorem 7.2 and the fact that the differential of
a bounded linear map is itself give
T'(y) =

[cp'(y)](x) dx =

We come now to the situation of most importance to us, where a point to
point map generates a function-to-function map by composition. Let A be an
open set in a normed linear space V, let S be an arbitrary set, and let a be the
set of bounded mapsf from S to A. Then a is a subset of the normed linear space
<B(S, V) of all bounded functions from S to V under the uniform norm. A function f E a will be an interior point of a if and only if the distance from the range
of f to the boundary of a is a positive number ~, for this is clearly equivalent to
saying that a includes a ball in <B(S, V) about the point f. Now let g be any
bounded mapping from A to a normed linear space W, and let G: a ~ <B(S, W)
be composition by g. That is, h = G(f) if and only if f E a and h = g 0 f. We
can consider both the continuity and differentiability of G, but we shall only
work out the differentiability theorem.
Theorem 14.3. Let the function g: A ~ W be differentiable at each point
a in A, and let dg(JI. be a bounded uniformly continuous function of a. Then
the mapping G: a ~ <B(S, W) defined by G(fl = go f is differentiable at

Therefore, II Til ::; b, and we are

In the above situation, if g is from A X U to W, so that G(f) is the function
h given by h(t) = g(j(t), t), then nothing is changed except that the theorem is
about dg l instead of dg. If, in addition, V is a product space V 1 X V 2, so that f
is of the form <hh> and [G(f)](t) = g(!I(t),f2(t), t), then our rules about

*15. THE CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS

The problems of the calculus of variations are simply critical-point problems of a
certain type with a characteristic twist in the way the condition dF a = 0 is used.
We shall illustrate the subject by proving one of its standard theorems.
Since we want to solve a constrained maximum problem in which the domain
is an infinite-dimensional vector space, a systematic discussion would start off

3.15

THE CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS

with a more general form of the Lagrange multiplier theorem. However, for our
purpose it is sufficient to note that if S is a closed plane M
a, then the restriction of F to S is equivalent to a new function on the vector space 111, and its
differential at {3 = T/
a in S is clearly just the restriction of dFfJ to M. The
requirement that {3 be a critical point for the constrained function is therefore
simply the requirement that dFfJ vanish on M.
Let F be a uniformly continuous differentiable real-valued function of three
variables defined on (an open subset of) W X W X IR, where W is a normed
linear space. Given a closed interval [a, b] C IR, let V be the normed linear space
e1([a, b], W) of smooth arcs f: [a, b] ~ W, with Ilfll taken as Ilflloo
11!'1100.
The problem is to maximize the (nonlinear) functional G(f) =
F(j(t), !'(t), t) dt,
subject to the restraints f(a) = a and feb) = {3. That is, we consider only
smooth arcs in W with fixed endpoints a and {3, and we want to find that arc
from a to {3 which maximizes (or minimizes) the integral. Now we can show
that G is a continuously differentiable function from (an open subset of) V to R
The easiest way to do this is to let X be the space e([a, b], W) of continuous arcs
under the uniform norm, and to consider first the more general functional K
from X X X to IR defined by K(f, g) =
F(j(t), get), t) dt. By Theorem 14.3
the integrand map <f, g>- 1---+ F(jO, gO, .) is differentiable from X X X to
e([a, b]) and its differential at <f, g>- evaluated at < h, k>- is the function

f:

Sincef 1---+
f(t) is a bounded linear functional on e, it is differentiable and equal
to its differential. The composite-function rule therefore implies that K is
differentiable and that

[dF1(h(t))

where the partial differentials in the integrand are at the point <f(t), get), t>-.
Now the pairs <f, g>- such thatf' exists and equals g form a closed subspace of
X X X which is isomorphic to V. It is obvious that they form a subspace, but
to see that it is closed requires the theory of the integral for parametrized arcs
from Chapter 4, for it depends on the representation f(t) = f(a)
f~ !,(s) ds
and the consequent norm inequality Ilf(t) - f(a) II :::; (t - a) 11!'1100. Assuming
this, we see that our original functional G is just the restriction of K to this subspace (isomorphic to) V, and hence is differentiable with

+

This differential dGf is called the first variation of G about f.
The fixed endpoints a and {3 for the arc f determine in turn a closed plane P
in V, for the evaluation maps (coordinate projections) 7rz: f 1---+ f(x) are bounded
and P is the intersection of the hyperplanes 7ra = a and 7rb = {3. Since P is a
translate of the subspace M = {f E V: f(a) = feb) = O}, our constrained

maximum equation is

dG/(h)

=

lab [dFl(h(t)) + dF 2(h'(t))] dt = 0

for all h in M.
We come now to the special trick of the calculus of variations, called the
lemma of Du Bois-Reymond.
Suppose for simplicity that W = IR. Then F is a function F(x, y, t) of three
real variables, the partial differentials are equivalent to ordinary partial derivatives, and our critical-point equation is

dG/(h) =

Jar

b

(aF . h + aF . h') = O.
ax
ay

If we integrate the first term in the integral by parts and remember that h(a)
h(b) = 0, we see that the equation becomes

=

where g = h'. Since h is an arbitrary continuously differentiable function except
for the constraints h(a) = h(b) = 0, we see that g is an arbitrary continuous
function except for the constraint f: get) dt = O. That is, aFjay - faFjax is
orthogonal to the null space N of the linear functional g ~ f: get) dt. Since the
one-dimensional space N 1. is clearly the set of constant functions,

our condition becomes

aF
taF
ay (f(t),f'(t), t) = Jo ax (f(s),I'(s), s) ds + C.
This equation implies, in particular, that the left member is differentiable. This
is not immediately apparent, since!, is only assumed to be continuous. Differentiating, we conclude finally that I is a critical point of the mapping G if and
only if it is a solution of the differential equation

:t :: (f(t),!'(t), t) =

:~ (f(t),f'(t), t),

which is called the Euler equation of the variational problem. It is an ordinary
differential equation for the unknown function I; when the indicated derivative
is computed, it takes the form

If W is not IR, we get exactly the same result from the general form of the

version of the above argument. (See Exercise 10.14 and 10.15 of Chapter 4.)
That is, the smooth arc / with fixed endpoints a and p is a critical point of the

This is now a vector-valued equation, with values in W*. If W is finite-dimensional, with dimension n, then a choice of basis makes W* into IRn, and this
vector equation is equivalent to n scalar equations

! ::i (j(t), f'(t), t) = :~ (j(t),f'(t), t),
where F is now a function of 2n + 1 real variables,

F(x, y, t)

F(xb ... , X n, Yb ... , Yn, t).

Finally, let us see what happens to the simpler v~riational problem (W = IR)
when the endpoints of/are not fixed. Now the critical-point equation is dG/(h) =

This has been only a quick look at the variational calculus, and the interested
reader can pursue it further in treatises devoted to the subject. There are many
more questions of the general type we have considered. For example, we may
want neither fixed nor completely free endpoints but freedom subj~ct to constraints. We shall take this up in Chapter 13 in the special case of the variational equations of mechanics. Or again, / may be a function of two or more
variables and the integral may be a multiple integral. In this case the Euler
equation may become a system of partial differential equations in the unknown/.
Finally, there is the question of sufficient conditions for the critical function to
give. a maximum or minimum value to the integral. This will naturally involve a
study of the second differential of the functional G, or its second variation, as it is
known in this subject.

THE CLASSIFICATION OF CRITICAL POIN.TS

Suppose that V and Ware normed linear spaces, that A is an open subset of V,
and that F: A ~ W is a continuously differentiable mapping. The first differential of F is the continuous mapping dF: l' ~ dF-y from A to Hom(V, W). W('
now want to study the differentiability of this mapping at the point a. Prpsumably, we know what it means to say that dF is differentiable at a. By
definition d(dF)a is a bounded linear transformation T from V to Hom(V, W)
such that A(dF)a(1]) - T(1]) = 0(1]). That is, dF a+'1 - dF a - T(7J) is all
element of Hom(V, W) of norm less than el17J11 for 71 sufficiently small. We St't
d2Fa = d(dF)a and repeat: d2Fa = d2FaO is a linear map from V to Hom(V, W),
d2Fa(1]) = d2Fa(1])(-) is an element of Hom(V, W), and d 2F a(1])U) is a vector
in W. Also, we know that d 2F a is equivalent to a bounded bilinear map

w:Vx V~W,
where w(7J, t) = d2Fa(1])(t).
The vector d 2F a(7J)(t) clearly ought to be some kind of second derivative of
F at a, and the reader might even conjecture that it is the mixed derivative ill
the directions t and 1].
Theorem 16.1. If F: A ~ W is continuously differentiable, and if th('
second differential d 2Fa exists, then for each fixed p. E V the functioll
D!,F: l' ~ D!,F(1') from A to W is differentiable at a and Dp(D!,F)(a) =

Proof, We use the evaluation-at-p. map eVIL: Hom(V, W) ~ W defined for a
fixed p. in V by ev!'(T) = T(p.). It is a bounded linear mapping. Then
(D!,F)(a)

= dFa(p.) = ev!'(dFa) = (ev!, dF)(a),

so that the function D!,F is the composition eVIL 0 dF. It is differentiable at
because d(dF)a exists and eVIL is linear. Thus (Dp(D!,F))(a) = d(D!,F)a(v) =c
d(ev!, 0 dF)a(v) = (ev!, 0 d(dF)a) (v) = ev!'[(d 2F a)(v)] = (d2F a(V)) (p.). 0

Thus,
Corollary I. If V = IR n in the above theorem, then the existence of d 2 Fa

Moreover, from the above considerations and Theorem 9.3 we can also
conclude that:
Theorem 16.2. If V = IR n , and if all the second partial derivatives
(o2F /OXi OXj) (a) exist and are continuous on the open set A, then the
second differential d2Fa exists on A and is continuous.

Lemma. If {Si}~ is a finite collection of linear maps on a vector space W

Conversely, if all the third partials exist and are continuous on A, then the

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

Proof. By the definition of d(dF)a, given

E,

there is a 8 such that

whenever 117]11 ~ 8. Of course, tl(dF)a(7]) = dF a+7I - dF a. If we write down
the same inequality with 7] replaced by 7]
r, then the difference of the transformations in the left members of the two inequalities is

and the triangle inequality therefore implies that

provided that both 7] and 7]
r have norms at most 8. We shall take II rll ~ 8/3
and 117]11 ~ 28/3. If we hold r fixed, and if we set T = d 2F a (-r) and G(~) =
F(~) - F(~
r), then this inequality becomes IldGa +7I - Til ~ 2E(II7]11 Ilrll),
and since it holds whenever 117]11 ~ 28/3, we can apply the corollary to Theorem

The reader will remember from the elementary calculus that a critical
point a for a function / [f'(a) = 0] is a relative extremum point if the second
derivativef"(a) exists and is not zero. In fact, if f"(a) < 0, then/has a relative
maximum at a, becausef"(a) < 0 implies thatf' is decreasing in a neighborhood
of a and the graph of / is therefore concave down in a neighborhood of a. Similarly, / has a relative minimum at a if f'(a) = 0 and f"(a) > O. If f"(a) = 0,
nothing can be concluded.
If / is a real-valued function defined on an open set A in a finite-dimensional
vector space V, if ex E A is a critical point of /, and if d2/a. exists and is a non-

singular element of Hom(V, V*), then we can draw similar conclusions about the
behavior of I near a, only now there is a richer variety of possibilities. The
reader is probably already familiar with what happens for a function I from 1R2
to IR. Then a may be a relative maximum point (a "cap" point on the graph
of I), a relative minimum point, or a saddle point as shown in Fig. 3.13 for the
graph of the translated function t:./a. However, it must be realized that new
axes may have to be chosen for the orientation of the saddle to the axes to look as
shown. Replacing I by t:./a amounts to supposing that 0 is the critical point and
that 1(0) = o. Note that if 0 i~_ a saddle point, then there are two complementary subspaces, the coordinate axes in the Fig. 3.13, such that 0 is a relative
maximum for Iwhen/is restricted to one of them, and a relative minimum point
for the restriction of I to the other.

Fig. 3.13

We shall now investigate the general case and find that it is just like the
two-dimensional case except that when there is a saddle point the subspace on
which the critical point is a maximum point may have any dimension from 1
to n - 1 [where d(V) = n). Moreover, this dimension is exactly the number of
-l's in the standard orthonormal basis representation of the quadratic form
q(~)

=

wa, ~) = d2IOt(~, ~).

Our hypotheses, then, are that I is a continuously differentiable real-valued
function on an open subset of a finite-dimensional normed linear space V, that
a E A is a critical point for I (dla = 0), and that the mapping d 21a.: V --+ V*
exists and is nonsingular. This last hypothesis is equivalent to assuming that the
bilinear form
'7) = d2Ia(~, '7) has a nonsingular matrix with respect to any
basis for V. We now use Theorem 7.1 of Chapter 2 to choose an w-orthonormal
basis {ai}~' Remember that this means that w(ai' aj) = 0 if i ¢ j, w(ai' ai) = 1
1, ... ,n. There cannot be
for i = 1, ... ,p, and w(ai' ai) = -1 for i = p
any 0 values for w(ai' ai) because the Inatrix tij = w(ai' aj) is nonsingular: if
w(ai' ai) = 0, then the whole ith column is zero, the column space has dimension :::;; n - 1, and the Inatrix is singular.
We can use the basis isomorphism tp to replace V by IR" (i.e., replace I by
1 0 tp), and we can therefore suppose that V = IR" and that the standard basis is

our hypothesis of w-orth0gonality is that (a2flaXi aXj) (a) = 0 for i ¢ j,
a 2flaxl = 1 for i = 1, ... ,p, and a 2flaxl = -1 for i = p + 1, ... , n.
Since p can have any value from 0 to n, there are n + 1 possibilities. We show
first that if p = n, then a is a relative minimum of f. In this case the quadratic
form q is said to be positive definite, since q(x) = w(x, x) is positive for every
nonzero x. We also say that the bilinear form w(x, y) = d 2fa(x, y) is positive
definite, and, in the language of Chapter 5, that w is a scalar product.

f be a continuously differentiable real-valued function
defined on an open subset A of R n , and let a E A be a critical point of fat
which d 2f exists and is positive definite. Thenf has a relative minimum at a.

Proof. We suppose, as above, that the standard basis {!5 i } ~ is w-orthonormal.
By the definition of d 2fa, given E, there is a 15 such that

whenever Ilyll ::::; 15. Now dfa = 0, since a is a critical point off, and d 2fa(x, y) =
L~ XiYi, by the assumption that {!5 i ) ~ is w-orthonormal. Therefore, if we use
the two-norm on IR and set y = tx, we have
Also, if h(t) = f(a + tx), then h'(s) = dfa+8x(X), and this inequality therefore
says that (1 - E)tllxl1 2 ::::; h'(t) ::::; (1 + E)tllxI1 2 • Integrating, and remembering
that h(l) - h(O) = f(a + x) - f(a) = fl.fa(x), we have

complementary space V 2 = L({~i}~+l)'
According to our remarks at the end of Section 2.7, we can read off the type
of a critical point for a function of two variables without orthonormalizing by
looking at the determinant of the matrix of the (assumed nonsingular) form d 2fa.

If it is positive, then a is either a relative minimum or a relative maximum. We
can tell which by following f along a single line, say the xraxis. Thus, if
a2f/ax~ < 0, then a is a relative maximum point. On the other hand, if the
above expression is negative, then a is a saddle point.
It is important for the calculus of variations that Theorem 16.4 remains
true when the domain space is replaced by a space of the general type that we
shall study in the next chapter, called a Banach space. The hypotheses now are
that a is a critical point of f, that q(~) = dfa(~, ~) is positive definite, and that
the scalar product norm qlJ 2 (see Chapter 5) is equivalent to. the given norm on
V. The proof remains virtually unchanged.
*17. HIGHER ORDER DIFFERENTIALS. THE TAYLOR FORMULA

We have seen that if V and Ware normed linear spaces, and if F is a differentiable mapping from an open set A in V to W, then its differential dF = dF(o)
is a mapping from A to Hom(V, W). If this mapping is differentiable on A, then
its differential d(dF) = d(dFk) is a mapping from A to Hom(V, Hom(V, W)).
We remember that an element of Hom(V, Hom(V, W)) is equivalent by duality
to a bilinear mapping from V X V to W, and if we designate the space of all such
bilinear mappings by Hom 2(V, W), then d(dF) can be considered to be from A to
Hom 2(V, W). We write d(dF) = d 2F, and call this mapping the second differential of F. In Section 16 we saw that d2Fa(~, 1/) = D~(D'1F)(a), and that if
V = IR n , then

is differentiable on A, then its differential, d(d 2F) = d 3F, is from A to
Hom(V, Hom 2(V, W)) = Hom 3 (V, W), the space of all trilinear mappings from
V 3 = V X V X V to W. Continuing inductively, we arrive at the notion of the nth
differential of F on A as a mapping from A to Hom(V, Hom n- 1(V, W)) =
Homn(V, W), the space of all n-linear mappings from vn to W. The theorem
that d2Fa is a symmetric element of Hom 2(V, W) extends inductively to show
that dnFa is a symmetric element of Homn(V, W). We shall omit this proof.
Our theorem on the evaluation of the second differential by mixed directional
derivatives also generalizes by induction to give
D~l'

The above description is logically simple, but it is inefficient in that it repeats
identical terms such as YIY2(a2Fjaxl aX2) and Y2Yl(a2Fjax2 aXl). We conclude
by describing for the interested reader the modern "multi-index" notation for this
very complicated situation.
Remember that we are looking at the mth term of the Taylor formula for F,
and that F has n variables.
For any n-tuple k = -< kll ... , kn >- of nonnegative integers, we define jkj
as L~ ki' and for x E IR n, we set Xk = XlklXl2 ... x nkn . Also we set Fk =

The general Taylor formula is too cumbersome to be of much use in practice;
it is principally of theoretical value. The Taylor expansions that we actually

A mapping from A to W which has continuous differentials of all orders

is designated Ck(A, W) or ek(A, W). It is clear that Ck(A, W) is a vect(i)l"'Space
(induction). Moreover, it can also be shown by induction that a composition
of Ck-maps is itself of class Ck. This depends on <recognizing the generail form of
the mth differential of a composition FoG as being a finite sum, each term of
which is a composition of functions chosen from F, dF, ... , dmF, G, dG, ... , dmG.
Functions of many variables are involved in these calculations, and it is
simplest to treat each as a function of a single n-tuplet variable and to apply the
obvious corollary of Theorem 8.1 that if Gt, ... , Gn are of class Ck, then so is
G = -< Gr, ... , Gn>, with dkG = -< dkGt, ... , dkGn>. As a special case of
composition, we can conclude that a product of Ck-maps is of class Ck.
We shall see in the next chapter that cP: T ~ T- I is a differentiable map on
the open set of invertible elements in Hom V (if V is a Banach space) and that
dCPT(H) = - T-IHT- I. Since -<S, H, T> ~ S-IHT-Ithen has continuous partial differentials, we can continue, and another induction shows that cP is of class
Ck for every k and that dm'PT(H b . . . , H m) is a finite sum of finite products of
T-t, HI, ... , H m' 'It then follows that a function F defined implicitly by a Ck_
function G is also of class ck, for its differential, as computed in the implicitfunction theorem, is then a composition of maps of class Ck-I.
A mapping F which is of class Ck for all k is said to be of class Coo, and it
follows from our remarks above that the family of Coo-maps is closed under all
the operations that we have met in the calculus. If the domain of F is an open
set in IRn, then FE eOO(A, W) if and only if all the partial derivatives of F exist
and are continuous on A.

CHAPTER 4

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

In this chapter we shall investigate two properties of subsets of a normed linear
space V which are concerned with the fact that in a certain sense all the points
which ought to be there really are there. These notions are largely independent
of the algebraic structure of V, and we shall therefore study them in their own
most natural setting, that of metric spaces. The stronger of these two properties,
compactness, helps to explain why the theory of finite-dimensional spaces is so
simple and satisfactory. The weaker property, completeness, is shared by
important infinite-dimensional normed linear spaces, and allows us to treat
these spaces in almost as satisfactory a way.
It is these properties that save the calculus from being largely a formal
theory. They allow us to define crucial elements by limiting processes, and are
responsible, for example, for an infinite series having a sum, a continuous realvalued function assuming a maximum value, and a definite integral existing.
For the real number system itself, the compactness property is equivalent to the
least upper bound property, which has already been an absolutely essential tool
in our construction of the differential calculus in Chapter 3.
In Sections 8 through 10 we shall apply completeness to the calculus. The
first of these sections is devoted to the existence and differentiability of functions
defined by power series, and since we want to include power series in an operator
T, we shall take the occasion to introduce and exploit the notion of a Banach
algebra. Next we shall prove the contraction mapping fixed-point theorem, which
is the missing ingredient in our unfinished proof of the implicit-function theorem
in Chapter 3 and which will be the basis for the fundamental existence and
uniqueness theorem for ordinary differential equations in Chapter 6. In Section
10 we shall prove a simple extension theorem for linear mappings into a complete
normed linear space and apply it to construct the Riemann integral of a paramatrized arc.
1. METRIC SPACES; OPEN AND CLOSED SETS

In the preceding chapter we occasionally treated questions of convergence and
continuity in situations where the domain was an arbitrary subset A of a normed
linear space V. In such discussions the algebraic structure of V fades into the
background, and the vector operations of V are used only to produce the combi195

nation Iia - !311, which is interpreted as the distance from a to!3. If we distill
out of these contexts what is essential to the convergence and continuity arguments, we find that we need a space A and a function p: A X A ~ JR, p(x, y)
being called the distance from x to y, such that

>

0 if x ¥- y, and p(x, x) = 0;
2) p(x, y) = p(y, x) for all x, YEA;
3) p(x, z) ::; p(x, y)
p(y, z) for all x, y, z E A.
1) p(x, y)

+

Any set A together with such a function p from A X A to JR is called a metric
space; the function p is the metric. It is obvious that a normed linear space is a
metric space under the norm metric pea,
= Iia - !311 and that any subset B
of a metric space A is itself a metric space under p r B X B. If we start with a
nice intuitive space, like JRn under one of its standard norms, and choose a weird
subset B, it will be clear that a metric space can be a very odd object, and may
fail to have almost any property one can think of.
Metric spaces very often arise in practice as subsets of normed linear
spaces with the norm metric, but they come from other sources too. Even in the
normed linear space context, metrics other than the norm metric are used.
For example, S might be a two-dimensional spherical surface in JR3, say S =
{x : r:,~ xl = I}, and p(x, y) might be the great circle distance from x to y. Or,
more generally, S might be any smooth two-dimensional surface in JR3, and
p(x, y) might be the length of the shortest curve connecting x to y in S.
In this chapter we shall adopt the metric space context for our arguments
wherever it is appropriate, so that the student may become familiar with this
more general but very intuitive notion. We begin by reproducing the basic
definitions in the language of metrics. Because the scalar-vector dichotomy is
not a factor in this context, we shall drop our convention that points be represented by Greek or boldface roman letters and shall use whatever letters we wish.

Proof. This amounts to the triangle inequality. For, if x E Ba(q), then p(x, q) <
a and p(x, p) ~ p(x, q) + p(q, p) < a+ p(p, q) = r, so that x E Br(P).
Thus Ba(q) C Br(P). 0
LeDlDla 1.2. If P is held fixed, then p(p, x) is a continuous function of x.

Proof. A symbol-by-symbol paraphrase of Lemma 3.1 of Chapter 3 shows that
Ip(p, x) - p(p, y)1 ~ p(x, y), so that p(p, x) is actually a Lipschitz function
with constant 1. 0
TheoreDl 1.1. The family ~ of all open subsets of a metric space S has the

following properties:
1) The union of any collection of open sets is open; that is, if {Ai: i E J} C
~, then UiEI Ai E ~.
2) The intersection of two open sets is open; that is, if A, B E ~, then
A nB E~.
3) 0, V E~.

Proof. These properties follow immediately from the definition. Thus any
point p in Ui A i lies in some A j, and therefore, since A j is open, some ball about p
is a subset of Aj and hence of the larger set Ui Ai. 0
Corollary. A set is open if and only if it is a union of open balls.

Proof. This follows from the definition of open set, the lemma above, and
property (1) of the theorem. 0
The union of all the open subsets of an arbitrary set A is an open subset of

A, by (1), and therefore is the largest open subset of A. It is called the interior
of A and is designated A into Clearly, p is in A int if and only if some ball about p
is a subset of A, and it is helpful to visualize A int as the union of all the balls
that are in A.
Definition. A set A is closed if A' is open.

The theorem above and De Morgan's law (Section 0.11) then yield the
following complementary set of properties for closed sets.
TheoreDl 1.2

1) The intersection of any family of closed sets is closed.
2) The union of two closed sets is closed.
3) 0 and V are closed.

Proof. Suppose, for example, that {Bi: i E J} is a family of closed sets. Then
the complement

Also, UiB[ = miBi)' by De Morgan's law (see Section 0.11). Thus niBi is
the complement of an open set and is closed. 0
Continuing our "complementary" development, we define the closure, if, of
an arbitrary set A as the intersection of all closed sets including A, and we have
from (1) above that if is the smallest closed set including A. De Morgan's law
implies the important identity
For F is a closed superset of A if and only if its complement U = F' is an open
subset of A'. By De Morgan's law the complement of the intersection of all such
sets F is the union of all such sets U. That is, the complement of if is (A')int.
This identity yields a direct characterization of closure:
Lemma 1.3. A point p is in

if if and only if every ball about p intersects A.

Proof. A point p is not in if if and only if p is in the interior of A', that is, if and
only if some ball about p does not intersect A. Negating the extreme members

of this equivalence gives the lemma. 0

p E iJA if and only if every ball about p intersects both A and A'.
Example. A ball Br(a) is an open set. In a normed linear space the closure of

Br(a) is the closed ball about a of radius r, H : p(~, a) ~ r}. This is easily seen
from Lemma 1.3. The boundary iJBr(a) is then the spherical surface of radius I'
about a, H: p(~, a) = r}. If some but not all of the points of this surface are
added to the open ball, we obtain a set that is neither open nor closed. The
student should expect that a random set he may encounter will be neither open
nor closed.

Continuous functions furnish an important source of open and closed sets
by the following lemma.
Lemma 1.4. If X and Yare metric spaces, and if f is a continuous mapping

from X to Y, then f-I[A] is open in X whenever A is open in Y.
Proof. If pEr I [A], then f(p) E A, and, since A is open, some ball B. (f(p)
is a subset of A. But the continuity of fat p says exactly that there is a ~ such
that f[Ba(p)] C B.(f(p). In particular, f[Ba(p)] C A and Ba(P) Cf-I[A].
Thus for each p inrI[A] there is a ball about p included inf-I[A], and this set
is therefore open. 0

4.1

METRIC SPACES; OPEN AND CLOSED SETS

Since f-I[A']

=

199

(f-I[A])', we also have the following corollary.

Corollary. Iff: X -- Y is continuous, thenrI[C] is closed in X whenever C

is closed in Y.
The converses of both of these results hold as well. As an example of the use
of this lemma, consider for a fixed a E X the continuous function f: X -- IR
defined by f(~D = p(~, a). The sets (-1',1'), [0,1'], and {r} are respectively open,
closed, and closed subsets of IR. Therefore, their inverse images under f-the ball
Br(a), the closed ball
pa, a) ~ r}, and the spherical surface
p(~, a) = r}
----<are respectively open, closed, and closed in X. In particular, the triangle
inequality argument demonstrating directly that Br(a) is open is now seen to be
unnecessary by virtue of the triangle inequality argument that demonstrates the
continuity of the distance function (Lemma 1.2).
It is not true that continuous functions take closed sets into closed sets in the
forward direction. For example, if f: IR -- IR is the arc tangent function, then
f[lR] = range f = (-7r /2, 7r/2), which is not a closed subset of IR. The reader
may feel that this example cheats and that we should only expect the f-image of a
closed set to be a closed subset of the metric space that is the range of f. He
might then consider f(x) = 2x/(1
x 2 ) from IR to its range [-1, 1]. The set
of positive integers Z+ is a closed subset of IR, but f[Z+] = {2n/ (1
n 2 )} ~ is not
closed in [-1, 1], since 0 is clearly in its closure.
The distance between two nonempty sets A and B, p(A, B), is defined as
glb {p( a, b) : a E A and b E B}. If A and B intersect, the distance is zero.
If A and B are disjoint, the distance may still be zero. For example, the interior
and exterior of a circle in the plane are disjoint open sets whose distance apart is
zero. The x-axis and (the graph of) the function f(x) = l/x are disjoint closed
sets whose distance apart is zero. As we have remarked earlier, a set A is closed
if and only if every point not in A is a positive distance from A. More generally,
for any set A a point p is in A if and only if p(p, A) = o.
We list below some simple properties of the distance between subsets of a
normed linear space.

However, this is a matter on which our intuition lets us down: if N is infinitedimensional, there may not be a closest point 71! For example, as we shall see
later in the exercises of Chapter 5, if V is the space e([ -1, 1]) under the twonorm Ilfll = (f!l f2)1/2, and if N is the set of functions g in V such that U g = 0,
then N is a closed subspace for which we cannot find such a "best" Ci. But if N is
finite-dimensional, we can always find such a point, and if V is a Hilbert space,
(see Chapter 5) we can also.

*2. TOPOLOGY

If X is an arbitrary set and 3 is any family of subsets of X satisfying properties
(1) through (3) in Theorem 1.1, then 3 is called a topology on X. Theorem 1.1
thus asserts that the open subsets of a metric space X form a topology on X.
The subsequent definitions of interior, closed set, and closure were purely
topological in the sense that they depended only on the topology 3, as were
Theorem 1.2 and the identity (A), = (A')int. The study of the consequences of
the existence of a topology is called general topology.
On the other hand, the definitions of balls and continuity given earlier were
metric definitions, and therefore part of metric space theory. In metric spaces,
then, we have not only the topology, but also our E-definitions of continuity and
balls and the spherical characterizations of closure and interior.
The reader may be surprised to be told now that although continuity and
convergence were defined metrically, they also have purely topological characterizations and are therefore topological ideas. This is easy to see if one keeps
in mind that in a metric space an open set is nothing but a union of balls. We
have:

f is continuous at p if and only if for every open set A containing f(p) there
exists an open set B containing p such that f[B] C A.
This local condition involving behavior around a single point p is more
fluently rendered in terms of the notion of neighborhood. A set A is a neighborhood of a point p if pEA into Then we have:
f is continuous at p if and only if for every neighborhood N of f(p) , r1[N]
is a neighborhood of p.
Finally there is an elegant topological characterization of global continuity.
Suppose that 8 1 and 8 2 are topological spaces. Then f: 8 1 -+ 8 2 is continuous

(everywhere) if and only if rl[A] is open whenever A is open. Also, f is continuous if and only if f-l[B] is closed whenever B is closed. These conditionH
are not surprising in view of Lemma 1.4.
3. SEQUENTIAL CONVERGENCE

In addition to shifting to the more general point of view of metric space theory,
we also want to add to our kit of tools the notion of sequential convergence,
which the reader will probably remember from his previous encounter with the
calculus. One of the principal reasons why metric space theory is simpler and
more intuitive than general topology is that nearly all metric arguments can be
presented in terms of sequential convergence, and in this chapter we shall
partially make up for our previous neglect of this tool by using it constantly and
in preference to other alternatives.
Definition. We say that the infinite sequence {xn} converges to the point a

if for every

E

there is an N such that
n

>N

=> p(xn' a)

<

E.

We also say that Xn approaches a as n approaches (or tends to) infinity, and
we call a the limit of the sequence. In symbols we write Xn ~ a as n ~ 00, or
limn-+oo Xn = a. Formally, this definition is practically identical with our earlier
definition of function convergence, and where there are parallel theorems the
arguments that we use in one situation will generally hold almost verbatim in
the other. Thus the proof of Lemma 1.1 of Chapter 3 can be alternated slightly
to give the following result.
Lemma 3.1. If {M and {"Ii} are two sequences in a normed linear space V,
then
~i ~ a and 7Ji ~ {3 => ~i + 7Ji ~ a + {3.
The main difference is that we now choose N as max {N b N 2} instead of
choosing ~ as min {~1' ~2}. Similarly:
Lemma 3.2. If

~i ~

a in V and

Xi ~

a in IR, then

Xi~i ~

aa.

As before, the definition begins with three quantifiers, (VE) (3N) (Vn). A
somewhat more idiomatic form can be obtained by rephrasing the definition in
terms of balls and the notion of "almost all n". We say that P(n) is true for
almost all n if P(n) is true for all but a finite number of integers n, or equivalently,
if (3N)(Vn>N)P(n). Then we see that
lim Xn = a if and only if every ball about a contains almost all the

Xn •

The following sequential characterization provides probably the most
intuitive way of viewing the notion of closure and closed sets.

Theorem. 3.1. A point x is in the closure A of a set A if and only if there is a

sequence {xn} in A converging to x.
Therefore, a set A is closed if and only if every convergent sequence lying
in A has its limit in A.

Proof. If {Xn} C A and Xn ~ x, then every ball about x contains almost every
and so, in particular, intersects A. Thus x E A by Lemma 1.3. Conversely,
if x E A, then every ball about x intersects A, and we can construct a sequence in
A that converges to x by choosing Xn as any point in B lin (X) n A. Since A is
closed if and only if A = A, the second statement of the theorem follows from
the first. 0
Xn>

There is also a sequential characterization of continuity which helps greatly
in using the notion of continuity in a flexible way. Let X and Y be metric spaces,
and let f be any function from X to Y.
Theorelll 3.2. The function f is continuous at a if and only if, for any
sequence {xn} in X, if Xn ~ a, then f(xn) ~ f(a).

Proof. Suppose first that f is continuous at a, and let {xn} be any sequence
converging to a. Then, given any E, there is a 0 such that
p(X , a)

<

0

=}

p(j(x) , f(a))

E,

by the continuity of f at a, and for this 0 there is an N such that

n

N

p(xn , a)

0,

because ;t·n ~ a. Combining these implications, we see that given E we have
found N so that n > N = } p(f(xn) , f(a)) < E. That is, f(xn) ~ f(a).
N ow suppose that f is not continuous at a. In considering such a negation
it is important that implicit universal quantifiers be made explicit. Thus, formally, we are assuming that ~(V'E)(30)(V'x)(p(x , a) < 0 = } p(j(X) , f(a)) < E),
that is, that (3E)(V'0)(3x)(p(x, a) < 0 &p(f(x) ,f(a)) ~ E). Such symbolization
will not be necessary after the reader has had some practice in computing logical
negations; the experienced thinker will intuit the correct negation without a
formal calculation. In any event, we now have a fixed E, and for each 0 of the
form 0 = lin we can let Xn be a corresponding x. We then have p(xn , a) < lin
and p(f(xn) , f(a)) ~ E for all n. The first inequality shows tnat Xn ~ a; the
second shows that f(xn)
f(a). Thus, if f is not continuous at a, then the
sequential condition is not satisfied. 0

+

The above type of argument is used very frequently and almost amounts to
an automatic proof procedure in the relevant situations. We want to prove, say,
that (V'x)(3y)(V'z)P(x, y, z). Arguing by contradiction, we suppose this false, so
that (3x)(V'y)(3z)~P(x, y, z). Then, instead of trying to use all numbers y, we
let y run through some sequence converging to zero, such as (lIn}, and we choose

204

4.3

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

one corresponding z, Zn, for each such y. We end up with "",P(x, lin, zn) for the
given x and all n, and we finish by arguing sequentially.
The reader will remember that two norms p and q on a vector space V are
equivalent if and only if the identity map ~ 1-+ ~ is continuous from -< V, p>- to
-< V, q>- and also from -< V, q>- to -< V, p>-. By virtue of the above theorem
we now see that:
Theorem 3.3. The norms p and q are equivalent if and only if they yield
exactly the same collection of convergent sequences.
Earlier we argued that a norm on a product V X W of two normed linear
spaces should be equivalent to 11-< a, ~ >- III = lIall + II ~II. Now with respect to
this sum norm it is clear that a sequence -< an, ~n >- in V X W converges to
-< a, ~ >- if and only if an ---+ a in V and ~n ---+ ~ in W. We now see (again by
Theorem 3.2) that:
Theorem 3.4. A product norm on V X W is any norm with the property
that -< an, ~n >- ---+ -< a, ~ >- in V X W if and only if an ---+ a in V and
~n ---+ ~ in W.

converging to -< 0, 0> in the plane such that f(x n, Yn) does not converge to O. This
example shows that continuity of a function of two variables is a stronger property
than continuity in each variable separately.
4. SEQUENTIAL COMPACTNESS

The reader is probably familiar with the idea of a subsequence. A subsequence of
a sequence {xn} is a new sequence {Ym} that is formed by selecting an infinite
number, but generally not all, of the terms X n , and counting them off in the
order of the selected indices. Thus, if nl is the first selected n, n2 the next, and
so on, and if we set Ym = x n.. , then we obtain the subsequence
or
Strictly speaking, this counting off of the selected set of indices n is a sequence
m ~ nm from Z+ to Z+ which preserves order: nm+l > nm for all m. And the
subsequence m ~ x n ... is the composition of the sequence n ~ Xn and the
selector sequence.
In order to avoid subscripts on subscripts, we may use the notation n(m)
instead of n m • In either case we are being conventionally sloppy: we are using
the same symbol' n' as an integer-valued variable, when we write X n , and as the
selector function, when we write n(m) or nm • This is one of the standard nota-

206

4.4

COMPA€TNESS AND COMPLETENESS

tional ambiguities which we tolerate in elementary calculus, because the cure is
considered worse than the disease. We could say: let f be a sequence, i.e., a
function from Z+ to IR. Then a subsequence of f is a composition fog, where g
is a mapping from Z+ to Z+ such that g(m + 1) > g(m) for all m.
If you have grasped the idea of subsequence, you should be able to see that
any infinite sequence of O's and l's, say {O, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ... }, can be
obtained as a subsequence of {O, 1,0, 1,0, 1, ... , [1 + (-1)n]/2, ...}.
If Xn --+ a, then it should be clear that every subsequence also converges to a.
We leave the details as an exercise. On the other hand, if the sequence {xn}
does not converge to a, then there is an E such that for every N there is some
larger n at which p(xn' a) ~ E. Now we can choose such an n for every N,
taking care that nN+l > nN, and thus choose a subsequence all of whose terms
are at a distance at least E from a. Then this sequence has no subsequence
converging to a. Thus, if {Xn} does not converge to a, then it has a subsequence
no (sub )subsequence of which converges to a. Therefore,
Lemma 4.1. If the sequence {xn} and the point a are such that every
subsequence of {xn} has itself a subsequence that converges to a, then
Xn --+ a.
This is a wild and unlikely sounding lemma, but we shall use it to prove a
most important theorem (Theorem 4.2).
Definition. A subset A of a metric space is sequentially compact if every
sequence in A has a subsequence that converges to a point of A.

Here, so to speak, we create convergence out of nothing. One would expect
a compact set to have very powerful properties, and perhaps suspect that there
aren't many such sets. We shall soon see, however, that every bounded closed
subset of IRn is compact, and it is in the theory of finite-dimensional spaces that
we most frequently use this notion. Sequential compactness in infinite-dimensional spaces is a much rarer phenomenon, but when it does occur it is very
important, as we shall see in our brief look at Sturm-Liouville theory in Chapter 6.
We begin with a few simple but important general results.
Lemma 4.2. If A is a sequentially compact subset of a metric space S,
then A is closed and bounded.
Proof. Suppose that {xn} C A and that Xn --+ b. By the compactness of A
there exists'a subsequence {Xn(i)}i that converges to a point a EA. But a subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit. Therefore,
a = band b E A. Thus A is closed.
Boundedness here will mean lying in some ball about a given point b. If A
is not bounded, for each n there exists a point Xn E A such that p(x n, b) > n.
By compactness a suBsequence {Xn(i)}i converges to a point a E A, and

This clearly contradicts P(Xn(i), b)

Continuous functions carry compact sets into compact sets. The proof of
the following result is left as an exercise.
TheorelD 4.1. If f is continuous and A is a sequentially compact subset of its
domain, then I[A] is sequentially compact.

A nonempty compact set A C iii' contains maximum and minimum elements.
This is because lub A is the limit of a sequence in A, and hence belongs to A
itself, since A is closed. Combining this fact with the above theorem, we obtain
the following well-known corollary.
Corollary. Iff is a continuous real-valued function and dom (f) is nonempty
and sequentially compact, then f is bounded and assumes maximum and
minimum values.

The following very useful result is related to the above theorem.
4.2. If f is continuous and bijective and dom (f) is sequentially
compact, then 1 is continuous.

TheorelD

r

Proof. We have to show that if Yn ~ Y in the range of I, and if Xn = f-1(Yn)
and: x = rl(y), then Xn ~ x. It is sufficient to show that every subsequence
{Xn(i)}i has itself a subsequence converging to x (by Lemma 4.1). But, since
dom (f) is compact, there is a subsequence {Xn(i(i»} i converging to some z, and
the continuity of f implies that f(z) = limi->oc f(Xn(i(j») = limi->oc Yn(i(j» = y.
Therefore, z = r1(y) = x, which is what we had to prove. Thus 1 is continuous. 0

r

We now take up the problem of showing that bounded closed sets in IR n are
compact. We first prove it for IR itself and then give an inductive argument
for IRn.
A sequence {xn} C IR is said to be increasing if Xn ~ x n+1 for all n. It is
strictly increasing if Xn < Xn+1 for all n. The notions of a decreasing sequence
and a strictly decreasing sequence are obvious. A sequence which is either increasing or decreasing is said to be monotone. The relevance of these notions here lies
in the following two lemmas.
LelDlDa

4.3. A bounded monotone sequence in IR is convergent.

Proof. Suppose that {xn} is increasing and bounded above. Let 1 be the least
upper bound of its range. That is, Xn ~ 1 for all n, but for every E, 1 - E is not an
upper bound, and so 1 - E < XN for some N. Then

Proof. Call Xn a peak term if it is greater than or equal to all later terms. If
there are infinitely many peak terms, then they obviously form a decreasing

208

4.4

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

subsequence. On the other hand, if there are only finitely many peak terms, then
there is a last one xno (or none at all), and then every later term is strictly less
than some other still later term. We choose any n1 greater than no, and then we
can choose n2 > n1 so that x nl < x n2 ' etc. Therefore, in this case we can choose
a strictly increasing subsequence. We have thus shown that any sequence {x n }
in IR has either a decreasing subsequence or a strictly increasing subsequence. 0
Putting these two lemmas together, we have:
Theorem 4.3. Every bounded sequence in IR has a convergent subsequence.
Now we can generalize to IR n by induction.
Theorem 4.4. Every bounded sequence in IR n has a convergent subsequence
(using any product norm, say II /11)'
Proof. The above theorem is the case n = 1. Suppose then that the theorem is
true for n - 1, and let {xm}m be a bounded sequence in IRn. Thinking of IR n as
IR n- 1 X IR, we have xm = -< ym, zm>-, and {ym} m is bounded in IRn-1, because if
x = -< y, z>-, then /lx/l 1 = /ly/l 1 Izi ;::: /lyl/ 1. Therefore, there is a subsequence
{yn(i)}i converging to some y in IR n-t, by the inductive hypothesis. Since
{Zn(i)} is bounded in IR, it has a subsequence {Zn(i(p»} p converging to some x in
IR. Of course, the corresponding subsubsequence {yn(i(p»} p still converges to y
in IR n-t, and then {xn(i(p»} p converges to x = -< y, Z>- in IR n = IR n- 1 X IR,
since its two component sequences now converge to y and z, respectively. We
have thus found a convergent subsequence of {xn}. 0

Theorem 4.5. If A is a bounded closed subset of IRn, then A is sequentially

so one of our inequalities is trivial. We also have /lxI/ - /lyl/ ~ /Ix - yl/ ~
all X - yl/ 1, so /lxI/ is a continuous function on IR n with respect to the one-norm.
Now the unit one-sphere S = {x: /lx/l1 = I} is closed and bounded and so
compact (in the one-norm). The restriction of the continuous function /lx/I to
this compact set S has a minimum value m, and m cannot be zero because S
does not contain the zero vector. We thus have /lx/l ;::: m/lxl/1 on S, and so
/lx/l ;::: m/lxl/ 1 on IRn, by homogeneity. Altogether we have found positive
constants a and m such that m/l /I 1 ~ /I /I ~ a/l /I 1. 0

5. COMPACTNESS AND UNIFORMITY

The word' uniform' is frequently used as a qualifying adjective in mathematics.
Roughly speaking, it concerns a "point" property P(y) which mayor may not
hold at each point y in a domain A and whose definition involves an existential
quantifier. A typical form for P(y) is (Vc)(3d)Q(y, c, d). Thus, if P(y) is 'f is
continuous at y', then P(y) has the form (VE)(3lJ)Q(y, E, lJ). The property holds
on A if it holds for all y in A, that is, if
(VyEA)[(Vc)(3d)Q(y, c, d)].

Here d will, in general, depend both on y and c; if either y or c is changed, the
corresponding d may have to be changed. Thus lJ in the definition of continuity
depends both on E and on the point y at which continuity is being asserted. The
property is said to hold uniformly on A, or uniformly in y, if a value d can be
found that is independent of y (but still dependent on c). Thus the property holds
uniformly in y if
(Vc)(3d)(VyEA)Q(y, c, d);
the uniformity of the property is expressed in the reversal of the order of the
quantifiers (VyEA) and (3d). Thus f is uniformly continuous on A if
(VE)(3lJ)(Vy, ZEA)[p(y, z)

<

lJ ==> p(J(y), fez))

<

E].

Now lJ is independent of the point at which continuity is being asserted, but still
dependent on E, of course.
We saw in Section 14 of the last chapter how much more powerful the point
condition of continuity becomes when it holds uniformly. In the remainder of
this section we shall discuss some other uniform notions, and shall see that the
uniform property is often implied by the point property if the domain over which
it holds is sequentially compact.
The formal statement forms we have examined above show clearly the
distinction between uniformity and nonuniformity. However, in writing an
argument, we would generally follow our more idiomatic practice of dropping out

the inside universal quantifier. For example, a sequence of functions Un} C W A
converges pointwise to f: A -+ W if it converges to f at every point P in A, that
is, if for every point p in A and for every f there is an N such that

this is why the norm IIfll"" is called the uniform norm.
Pointwise convergence does not imply uniform convergence. Thus fn(x) =
xn on A = (0, 1) converges pointwise to the zero function but does not converge
uniformly.
Nor does continuity on A imply uniform continuity. The function f(x) =
1/x is continuous on (0, 1) but is not uniformly continuous. The function
sin (l/x) is continuous and bounded on (0, 1) but is not unifomlly continuous.
Compactness changes the latter situation, however.
Theorem 5.1. If f is continuous on A and A is compact, then f is uniformly
continuous on A.

Proof. This is one of our "automatic" negation proofs.

This completes the proof by nega-

The compactness of A does not, however, automatically convert the pointwise convergence of a sequence of functions on A into uniform convergence. The
"piecewise linear" functions fn: [0, 1] -+ [0, 1] defined by the graph shown in
Fig. 4.1 converge pointwise to zero on the compact domain [0, 1], but the convergence is not uniform. (However, see Exercise 5.4.)

We pointed out earlier that the distance between a pair of disjoint closed
sets may be zero. However, if one of the closed sets is compact, then the distance
must be positive.
Theorem 5.2. If A and C are disjoint nonempty closed sets, one of which is
compact, then p(A, C) > o.

Proof. The proof is by automatic contradiction, and is left to the reader.

This result is again a uniformity condition. Saying that a set A is disjoint
from a closed set C is saying that (Vx EA )(3r>O) (Br(x) n C = 0). Saying that
p(A, C) > 0 is saying that (3r>O)(Vx EA ) •••
As a last consequence of sequential compactness, we shall establish a very
powerful property which is taken as the definition of compactness in general
topology. First, however, we need some preparatory work. If A is a subset of a
metric space S, the r-neighborhood of A, Br[A], is simply the union of all the balls
of radius r about points of A:
Br[A]

= U {Br(a) : a E A} = {x: (3a EA ) (p(x, a) < r)}.

A subset A C S is r-dense in S if S C Br[A], that is, if each point of S is closer
than r to some point of A.
A subset A of a metric space S is dense in S if A = S. This is the same as
saying that for every point p in S there are points of A arbitrarily close to p.
The set iQ of all rational numbers is a dense subset of the real number system IR,
because any irrational real number x can be arbitrarily closely approximated by
rational numbers. Since we do arithmetic in decimal notation, it is customary to
use decimal approximations, and if 0 < x < 1 and the decimal expansion of
x is x = L~ an/lOn, where each an is an integer and 0 ~ an < 10, then
:Ef an/IOn is a rational number differing from x by less than lO-N. Note that A
is a dense subset of B if and only if A is r-dense in B for every positive r.
A set B is said to be totally bounded if for every positive r there is a finite set
which is r-dense in B. Thus for every positive r the set B can be covered by a
finite number of balls of radius r. For example, the n - 1 numbers {i/nH- 1 are
(l/n)-dense in the open interval (0, 1) for each n, and so (0, 1) is totally bounded.

Total boundedness is a much stronger property than boundedness, as the
following lemma shows.
Lemma 5.1. If the normed linear space V is infinite-dimensional, then its

of balls of radius -1.
Proof. Since V is not finite-dimensional, we can choose a sequence {an} such
that an+l is not in the linear span M n of {aI, ... , an}, for each n. Since M n is
closed in V, by the corollary of Theorem 4.6, we can apply Lemma 1.5 to find
a vector ~n in M n such that II ~n II = 1 and p( ~n' M n-l) > i for all n > 1.

Ilfnlloo = 1 for all nand Ilfn - fmlloo = 1 if n ¢ m. Thus no ball of radius i can
contain more than one of the functions f n, and accordingly the closed unit ball in
V cannot be covered by a finite number of balls of radius l

+

Lemma 5.2. Every sequentially compact set A is totally bounded.
Proof. If A is not totally bounded, then there exists an r such that no finite
subset F is r-dense in A. We can then define a sequence {Pn} inductively by
taking PI as any point of A, P2 as any point of A not in Br(PI), and Pn as any
point of A not in Br[U~-l Pi] = U~-l Br(Pi). Then {Pn} is a sequence in A
such that P(Pi' Pj) ~ r for all i ¢ j. But this sequence can have no convergent
subsequence. Thus, if A is not totally bounded, then A is not sequentially compact, proving the lemma. 0
Corollary. A normed linear space V is finite-dimensional if and only if its
closed unit ball is sequentially compact.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 4.4 in one direction and from the above two
lemmas in the other direction. 0
Lemma 5.3. Suppose that A is sequentially compact and that {Ei : i E J}
is an open covering of A (that is, {Ei} is a family of open sets and A C UiEi).
Then there exists an r > 0 with the property that for every point P in A the
ball Br(P) is included in some E j •
Proof. Otherwise, for every r there is a point P in A such that Br(P) is not a subset of any E j • Take r = l/n, with corresponding sequence {Pn}. Thus Bl/n(Pn)
is not a subset of any E j • Since A is sequentially compact, {Pn} has a convergent
subsequence, Pn(m) ~ P as m ~ 00. Since {Ei} covers A, some E j contains p,

and then B.(p) C E j for some E > 0, since E j is open. Taking m large enough so
that l/m < E/2 and also P(Pn(m), p) < E/2, we have
Blfn(m)(Pn(m» C B.(p) C Ej,

contradicting the fact that Blfn(Pn) is not a subset of any E i . The lemma has
thus been proved. 0
Theorem 5.S. If ff is an open covering of a sequentially compact set A,
then some finite subfamily of ff covers A.
Proof. By the lemma immediately above there exists an l' > 0 such that for
every P in A the ball Br(P) lies entirely in some set of ff, and by the first lemma
there exist Pb ... , Pn in A such that A C U~ Br(Pi). Taking corresponding sets
Ei in ff such that Br(Pi) C Ei for i = 1, ... , n, we clearly have A C U~ E i • 0

In general topology, a set A such that every open covering of A includes a
finite covering is said to be compact or to have the Heine-Borel property. Thc
above theorem says that in a metric space every sequentially compact set if:;
compact. We shall see below that the reverse implication also holds, so that thc
two notions are in fact equivalent on a metric space.
Theorem 5.4. If A is a compact metric space, then A is sequentially
compact.
Proof. Let {xn} be any sequence in A, and let ff be the collection of open balls B
such that B contains only finitely many Xi. If ff were to cover A, then by compactness A would be the union of finitely many balls in ff, and this would clearly
imply that the whole of A contains only finitely many Xi, contradicting the fact
that {Xi} is an infinite sequence. Therefore, ff does not cover A, and so there is a
point X in A such that every ball about x contains infinitely many of the Xi.
More precisely, every ball about x contains Xi for infinitely many indices i. It can
now be safely left to the reader to see that a subsequence of {xn} converges to x. 0

6. EQUICONTINUITY

The application of sequential compactness that we shall make in an infinitedimensional context revolves around the notion of an equicontinuou8 family of
functions. If A and B are metric spaces, then a subset fr C BA is said to be
equicontinuou8 at Po in A if all the functions of fr are continuous at Po and if
given E, there is a ~ which works for them all, i.e., such that
p(p, Po)

<

~ => p(j(p),f(Po»

<E

for every fin fr.

The family fr is uniformly equicontinuou8 if ~ is also independent of Po, and so is
dependent only on E. Our quantifier string is thus (VE)(3~)(Vp, qEA)(Vr'.f).
For example, given m > 0, let fr be a collection of functions f from (0, 1) to
(0, 1) such that!' exists and 1f'1 :$ m on (0, 1). Then If(x) - f(y) I :$ mix - yl,
by the ordinary mean-value theorem. Therefore, given any E, we can take
~ = Elm and have
Ix - yl < ~ => If(x) - f(y)1 < E
for all x, y E (0, 1) and all f E fr. The collection fr is thus uniformly equicontinuous.

A and B are totally bounded metric spaces, and if ff is a
uniformly equicontinuou8 subfamily of BA, then fr is totally bounded in the

and let E be a finite subset of B which is (E/4)-dense in B. Let G be the set ED of
all functions on D into E. G is of course finite; in fact, #G = n m , where m = #D

We claim that the collections 5 g cover 5 and that each 5 g has diameter at most E.
We will then obtain a finite E-dense subset of 5 by choosing one function from
each nonempty 5 g , and the theorem will be proved.
To show that every f E 5 is in some 5 g , we simply construct a suitable g.

in essentially the same way. One additional fact has to be established, namely,
that the limit map (corresponding to g in the above theorem) is linear.
Theorem 7.7. A closed subset of a complete metric space is complete. A

complete subset of any metric space is closed.

Proof. The proof is left to the reader.

It follows from Theorem 7.7 that a complete metric space A is absolutely
closed, in the sense that no matter how we extend A to a larger metric space
B, A is always a closed subset of B. Actually, this property is equivalent to
completeness, for if A is not complete, then a very important construction of
metric space theory shows that A can be completed. That is, we can construct
a complete metric space B which includes A. Now, if A is not complete, then
the closure of A in B, being complete, is different from A, and A is not absolutely
closed.
See Exercise 7.21 through 7.23 for a construction of the completion of a
metric space. The completion of a normed linear space is of course a Banach
space.

e(A, W) be the space of continuous functions from A to W, and set
CBe(A, W)

CB(A, W) n e(A, W).

Corollary. me(A, W) is a Banach space.
Theorem 7.9. If A is a sequentially compact metric space, then A is com-

plete.
Proof. A Cauchy sequence in A has a subsequence converging to a limit in A,
and therefore, by Lemma 7.2, itself converges to that limit. Thus A is complete. 0

In Section 5 we proved that a compact set is also totally bounded. It can be
shown, conversely, that a complete, totally bounded set A is sequentially compact, so that these two properties together are equivalent to compactness.
The crucial fact is that if A is totally bounded, then every sequence in A
has a Cauchy subsequence. If A is also complete, this Cauchy subsequence will
converge to a point of A. Thus the fact that total boundedness and completeness together are equivalent to compactness follows directly from the next
lemma.
Lemma 7.4. If A is totally bounded, then every sequence in A has a Cauchy

subsequence.
Proof. Let {Pm} be any sequence in A. Since A can be covered by a finite
number of balls of radius 1, at least one ball in such a covering contains infinitely
many of the points {Pm}. More precisely, there exists an infinite set M 1 C z+
such that the set {Pm: m E M I} lies in a single ball of radius 1. Suppose that
M b . . . , M n C Z+ have been defined so that M i + 1 C M;for i = 1, ... ,n - 1,
M n is infinite, and {Pm: m E M i } is a subset of a ball of radius l/i for i = 1, ... ,n.
Since A can be covered by a finite family of balls of radius l/(n 1), at least
one covering ball contains infinitely many points of the set {Pm: mE M n}. More
precisely, there exists an infinite set M n+l C M n such that {Pm: m E M n+l}
is a subset of a ball of radius l/(n 1). We thus define an infinite sequence
{M n} of subsets of Z+ having the above properties.
N ow choose ml E M 1, m2 E M 2 so that m2 > ml, and, in general, mn+l E
Mn+l so that m n+l > m". Then the subsequence {PmJn is Cauchy. For
given E, we can choose n so that l/n < E/2. Then i, j > n ==> mi, mj E M n ==>

Theorem 7.10. A metric space S is sequentially compact if and only if S is
totally bounded and complete.
The next three sections will be devoted to applications of completeness to
the calculus, but before embarking on these vital matters we should say a few
words about infinite series. As in the ordinary calculus, if {~n} is a sequence in a
normed linear space V, we say that the series :E ~i converges and has the sum a,
and write:E~ ~i = a, if the sequence of partial sums converges to a. This means
that Un - t a as n - t ao, where Un is the finite sum :Ei ~i for each n. We say that
:E ~i converges absolutely if the series of norms :E II M converges in IR. This is
abuse of language unless it is true that every absolutely convergent series converges, and the importance of the notion stems from the following theorem.
Theorem 7.11. If V is a Banach space, then every absolutely convergent
series in V is convergent.

Proof. Let:E ~i be absolutely convergent. This means that :E I ~ill converges in
R, i.e., that the sequence {sn} converges in R, where Sn = :Ei II ~ill. If m < n,
then

Since {Si} is Cauchy in R, this inequality shows that {Ui} is Cauchy in V and
therefore, because V is complete, that {un} is convergent in V. That is, :E ~i is
convergent in V. 0
The reader will be asked to show in an exercise that, conversely, if a normed
linear space V is such that every absolutely convergent series converges, then V
is complete. This property therefore characterizes Banach spaces.
We shall make frequent use of the above theorem. For the moment we
note just one corollary, the classical Weierstrass comparison test.
Corollary. If {In} is a sequence of bounded real-valued (or W-valued, for
some Banach space W) functions on a common domain A, and if there is a
sequence {M n} of positive constants such that :E M n is convergent and
IIfnll"" ~ Mn for each n, then :E fn is uniformly convergent.

Proof. The hypotheses imply that :Ellfnll"" converges, and so :E fn converges in
the Banach space CB(A, W) by the theorem. But convergence in CB(A, W) is
uniform convergence. 0

7.21 Prove that the sum of a uniformly convergent series of infinitesimals (all on the

8. A FIRST LOOK AT BANACH ALGEBRAS

When we were considering the implicit-function theorem and the inverse-function
theorem in· the last chapter, we saw how useful it is to know that if a transformation T has an inverse T- 1 , then so does S whenever liS - Til is small enough,
and that the mapping T 1-+ T- 1 is continuous on the open set of all invertible
elements. When the spaces in question are finite-dimensional, these facts can
be made to follow from the continuity of the determinant function T 1-+ /leT)
from Hom V to IR. It is also possible to produce them by arguing directly in
terms of upper and lower bounds for T and its close approximations S. But the
most natural, most elegant,. and-in the case of Banach spaces-easiest way to
prove these things is to show that if V is a Banach space and T in Hom V has
norm less than one, then the sum of the geometric series :EO' Tn is the inverse of
I - T, just as in the elementary calculus. But in making this argument, the
fact that T is a linear transformation has little importance, and we shall digress
for a moment to explore this situation.
Ust us summarize the norm and algebraic properties of Hom V when V is a
Banach space. First of all, we know that Hom V is also a Banach space. Second,
it is an algebra. That is, it possesses an associative mUltiplication operation
(composition) that relates to the linear operations according to the following
laws:
S(TI
(SI

+ T 2) = ST + ST2,
1

+ S2)T =

SIT + S2T,
c(ST) = (cS)T = S(cT).

Finally, multiplication is related to the norm by

IISTII 5 IISII II Til

and

11111 = 1.

This list of properties constitutes exactly the axioms for a Banach algebra.
Just as we can see certain properties of functions most clearly by forgetting
that they are functions and considering them only as elements of a vector space,
now it turns out that we can treat certain properties of transformations in
Hom(V) most simply by forgetting the complicated nature of a linear transformation and considering it merely as an element of an abstract Banach algebra.A.

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

The most important simple thing we can do in a Banach algebra that we
couldn't do in a Banach space is to consider power series. The following theorem
shows that the geometric series, in particular, plays the same central role here
that it plays in elementary calculus. Since we are not thinking of the elements of
A as transformations, we shall designate them by lower-case letters; e is the
identity of A.
Theorem 8.1. If A is a Banach algebra, and if x in A has norm less than one,

Theorem 8.2. The set ;n of invertible elements in a Banach algebra A is

Corollary. If V and Ware Banach spaces, then the invertible elements in
Hom(V, W) form an open set, and the map T 1-4 T- 1 is continuous on this

domain.
Proof. Suppose that T- I exists, and set m = liT-III. Then if liT - SII < 11m,
we have III - T-1SII ~ liT-III liT - SII < 1, and so T-1S = I - (I - T-IS)
is an invertible element of Hom V. Therefore, S = T(T-IS) is invertible and
S-I = (T-1S)-IT- 1. The continuity of S 1-4 S-I is left to the reader. 0

A FIRST LOOK AT BANACH ALGEBRAS

We saw above that the map x 1-+ (e - X)-l from the open unit ball B1(O) in
a Banach algebra A to A is the sum of the geometric power series. We can define
many other mappings by convergent power series, at hardly any greater effort.
Theorem 8.3. Let A be a Banach algebra. Let the sequence {an} C A and
the positive number ~ be such that the sequence {llanll ~n} is bounded. Then
L anx n converges for x in the ball Ba(O) in A, and if 0 < s < ~,then the
series converges uniformly on B8(O).

Proof. Set r = s/~, and let b be a bound for the sequence {llanll ~n}. On the
ball Bs(O) we then have Ilanxnll ::; Ilanlls n = Ilanll ~nrn ::; br n, and the series
therefore converges uniformly on this ball by comparison with the geometric
series bL rn, since 1" < 1. 0
The series of most interest to us will have real coefficients. They are included
in the above argument because the product of the vector x and the scalar t is
the algebra product (te)x. In addition to dealing with the above geometric series,
we shall be particularly interested in the exponential function eX =
xn In!.
The usual comparison arguments of the elementary calculus show just as easily
here that this series converges for every x in A and uniformly on any ball.
It is natural to consider the differentiability of the maps from A to A defined
by such convergent series, and we state the basic facts below, starting with a
fundamental theorem on the differentiability of a limit of a sequence.

commutative Banach algebra. The function x ~ eX =
xnln! can be defined
just as easily on any Banach algebra A, but it is not nearly as pleasant when A
is noncommutative. However, one thing that we can always do, and often
thereby save the day, is to restrict the exponential mapping to a commutative
subalgebra of A, say that generated by a single element x. For example, we can
consider the parametrized arc 'Y(t) = etx (x fixed) into any Banach algebra A,

9. THE CONTRACTION MAPPING FIXED-POINT THEOREM

In this section we shall prove the very simple and elegant fixed-point theorem for
contraction mappings, and then shall use it to complete the proof of the implicitfunction theorem. Later, in Chapter 6, it will be the basis of our proof of the
fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem for ordinary differential equations. The section concludes with a comparison of the iterative procedure of the
fixed-point theorem and that of Newton's method.

THE CONTRACTION MAPPING FIXED-POINT THEOREM

229

A mapping K from a metric space X to itself is a contraction if it is a Lipschitz
mapping with constant less than 1; that is, if there is a constant C with 0 < C < 1
such that p(K(x), K(y)) ~ Cp(x, y) for all x, y EX. A fixed point of K is, of
course, a point x such that K(x) = x.
A contraction K can have at most one fixed point, since if K(x) = x and
K(y) = y, thenp(x, y) = p(K(x), K(y)) ~ Cp(x, y), and so (1 - C)p(x, y) ~ O.
Since C < 1, this implies that p(x, y) = 0 and x = y.
Theorem 9.1. Let X

K: X -

be a nonempty complete metric space, and let

X be a contraction. Then K has a (unique) fixed point.

Proof. Choose any Xo in X, and define the sequence {x n } 0inductively by setting
Xl = K(xo), X2 = K(Xl) = K2(XO)' and Xn = K(Xn_l) = Kn(xo). Set 6 =
P(Xh xo). Thenp(x2, Xl) = P(K(Xl), K(xo)) ~ Cp(Xl, xo) = C6, and, by induc-

tion,
p(xn+l> x n ) = p(K(x n), K(Xn_l)) ~ Cp(xn> Xn-l) ~ C· cn-l 6 = C n 6.
It follows that {x n } is Cauchy, for if m

< C n6/(1

- C),

and C n _ 0 as n - 00, because C < 1. Since X is complete, {xn} converges to
some a in X, and it then follows that K(a) = lim K(xn) = lim Xn+l = a, so
that a is a fixed point. 0

In practice, we meet mappings K that are contractions only near some
particular point p, and we have to establish that a suitable neighborhood of p
is carried into itself by K. We show below that if K is a contraction on a ball
about p, and if K doesn't move the center of p very far, then the theorem can
be applied.
Corollary 1. Let D be a closed ball in a complete metric space X, and let

X be a contraction which moves the center of D a distance at
most (1 - C)r, where r is the radius of D and C is the contraction constant.
Then K has a unique fixed point and it is in D.
K: D -

Proof. We simply check that the range of K is actually in D. If p is the center
of D and X is any point in D, then

p(K(x), p) ~ p(K(x), K(p))
p(K(p), p)
~ Cp(x, p)
(1 - C)r ~ Cr

Corollary 2. Let B be an open ball in a complete metric space X, and let
K: B - X be a contraction which moves the center of B a distance less than
(1 - C)r, where r is the radius of Band C is the contraction constant.
Then K has a unique fixed point.

Proof. Restrict K to any slightly smaller closed ball D concentric with B, and
apply the above corollary. 0

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

Corollary 3. Let K be a contraction on the complete metric space X, and
suppose that K moves the point x a distance d. Then the distance from x to
the fixed point is at most dl(1 - C), where C is the contraction constant.

Proof. Let D be the closed ball about x of radius r = dl(1 - C), and apply
Corollary 1 to the restriction of K to D. It implies that the fixed point is in D. 0

We now suppose that the contraction K contains a parameter s, so that K
is now a function of two variables K(s, x). We shall assume that K is a contraction in x uniformly over s, which means that peKes, x), K(s, y)
Cp(x, y)
for all x, y, and s, where 0 < C < 1. We shall also assume that K is a continuous function of s for each fixed x.

s

Corollary 4. Let K be a mapping from S X X to X, where X is a complete
metric space and S is any metric space, and suppose that K(s, x) is a contraction in x uniformly over s and is continuous in s for each x. Then the
fixed point P. is a continuous function of s.

Proof. Given

f, we use the continuity of K in its first variable around the point
to choose 5, so that if pes, t) < 5, then the distance from K(s, PI) to
K(t, Pt) is at most f. Since K(t, PI) = Pt, this simply says that the contraction
with parameter value 8 moves PI a distance at most f, and so the distance from
PI to the fixed point P. is at most f/(1 - C) by Corollary 3. That is, pes, t) <
5 ~ p(P., Pt) < f/(1 - C), where C is the uniform contraction constant, and
the mapping s 1--+ P. is accordingly continuous at t. 0

-< t, PI >-

Combining Corollaries 2 and 4, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 9.2. Let B be a ball in a complete metric space X, let S be any
metric space, and let K be a mapping from S X B to X which is a contraction

in its second variable uniformly over its first variable and is continuous in its
first variable for each value of its second variable. Suppose also that K
moves the center of B a distance less than (1 - C)r for every s in S, where r
is the radius of Band C is the uniform contraction constant. Then for each s
in S there is a unique P in B such that K(s, p) = p, and the mapping
s 1--+ P is continuous from S to B.
We can now complete the proof of the implicit-function theorem.
Theorem 9.3. Let V, W, and X be Banach spaces, let A X B be an open
subset of V X W, and let G: A X B - X be continuous and have a continuous second partial differential. Suppose that the point -< ex, f3 >- in
A X B is such that G(ex, (3) = 0 and dG"<.a..fJ> is invertible. Then there are
open balls M and N about ex and f3, respectively, such that for each ~ in M
there is a unique." in N satisfying G(~, .,,) = O. The function F thus
uniquely defined near -< ex, f3 >- by the condition G(~, F(~) = 0 is continuous.

Proof. Set T = dG"<.a..fJ> and K(~,.,,) = ." - T-l(G(~, .,,). Then K is a continuous mapping from A X B to W such that K(ex, (3) = f3, and K has a con-

4.9

THE CONTRACTION MAPPING FIXED-POINT THEOREM

231

tinuous second partial differential such that dK~a,(j> = 0. Because dK~p,.> is
a continuous function of -<p., v>-, we can choose a product ball 111 X N about
-< a, (3 >- on which dK~p,.> is bounded by!, and we can then decrease the ball M
if necessary so that for p. in M we also have IIK(p., (3) - (311 < 1"/2, where l' is the
radius of the ball N. The mean-value theorem for differentials implies that K is
a contraction in its second variable with constant t. The preceding theorem
therefore shows that for each ~ in M there is a unique." in N such that K(t, .,,) =
." and the mapping F: ~ 1-+ ." is continuous. Since K(~, .,,) = ." if and only if
G(~, .,,) = 0, we are done. 0
Theorems 8.2 and 9.3 complete the list of ingredients of the implicit-function
theorem. (However, see Exercise 9.8.)
We next show, in the other direction, that if a contraction depending on a
parameter is continuously differentiable, then the fixed point is a continuously
differentiable function of the parameter.
Theorem 9.4. Let V and W be Banach spaces, and let K be a differentiable
mapping from an open subset A X B of V X W to W which satisfies the
hypotheses of Theorem 9.2. Then the function F from A to B uniquely
defined by the equation K(~, F(~)) = F(~) is differentiable.

Proof. The inequality IIK(~, .,,') - K(~, .,,")11 ~ Gil.,,' - .,,"11 is equivalent to
IldK~a,(j>11 ~ G for all -<a, (3>- in A X B. We now define G by G(~, .,,) =
." - K(~, .,,), and observe that dG 2 = 1 - dK 2 and that dG 2 is therefore
invertible by Theorem 8.1. Since G(~, F(~)) = 0, it follows from Theorem 11.1
of Chapter 3 that F is differentiable and that its differential is obtained by
differentiating the above equation. 0
Corollary. If K is continuously differentiable, then so is F.

* We should emphasize that the fixed-point theorem not only has the implicitfunction theorem as a consequence, but the proof of the fixed-point theorem
gives an iterative procedure for actually finding the value of F(~), once we
know how to compute T- 1 (where T = dG~a,(j». In fact, for a given value of
~ in a small enough ball about -< a, (3 >- consider the function G(~, .). If we
set K(~, .,,) = ." - T-IG(~, .,,), then the inductive procedure

"'i+I

= K(~,

."D

becomes
(9.1)

The meaning of this iterative procedure is easily seen by studying the graph of
the situation where V = W = RI. (See Fig. 4.4.) As was proved above, under
suitable hypotheses, the series EII"'i+l - "'ill converges geometrically.
It is instructive to compare this procedure with Newton's method of elementary calculus. There the iterative scheme (9.1) is replaced by

linear transformations Si.

Let us suppress the ~ which will be fixed in the argument and consider a map

T = i), we shall show that for some c (which can be made large if IIG(O)II is

We end this section with an example of the fixed-point iterative procedure in
its simplest context, that of the inverse-mapping theorem. We suppose that
H(O) = 0 and that dH(j1 exists, and we want to invert H near zero, i.e., solve
the equation H(1/) - ~ = 0 for 1/ in terms of~. Our theory above tells us that
the 1/ corresponding to ~ will be the fixed point of the contraction K(~, 1/) =
1/ - T- 1H(1/) + T-l(~), where T = dH o. In order to make our example as

234

Consider the mapping x = H(u) defined by x = u

This cancellation of the first-order terms is the practical expression of the fact
that in forming K(~, .,,) = ." - T-IG(~, .,,), we have acted to make dK 2 = 0 at
the "center point" (the origin here). We naturally start the iteration with
Uo = 0, and then our fixed-point sequence proceeds

10. THE INTEGRAL OF A PARAMETRIZED ARC

In this section we shall make our final application of completeness. We first,
prove a very general extension theorem, and then apply it to the construction of
the Riemann integral as an extension of an elementary integral defined for step
functions.
TheoreD1 10.1. Let U be a subspace of a normed linear space V, and let 7'

be a bounded linear mapping from U to a Banach space W. Then T has a
uniquely determined extension to a bounded linear transformation 8 from
the closure D to W. Moreover, 11811 = IITII.

ProoJ. Fix a E D and choose {~n} C U so that ~n -+ a. Then {~n} is Cauchy and
{T(~n)} is Cauchy (by the lemmas of Section 7), so that {T(~n)} converges to some (3 E W. If {lIn} is any other sequence in U converging to a,
then ~n - lIn -+ 0, T(~n) - T(lIn) = T(~n - lIn) -+ 0, and so T(lIn) -+ {3 also.
Thus {3 is independent of the sequence chosen, and, clearly, (3 must be the valuc
8(a) at a of any continuous extension 8 of T. If a E U, then (3 = lim T(a n) =
T(a) by the continuity of T. We thus have 8 uniquely defined on D by the
requirement that it be a continuous extension of T.
I t remains to be shown that 8 is linear and bounded by II Til. For any a, {3 E D
we choose {~n}, {lIn} C U, so that ~n -+ a and lIn -+ (3. Then x~n + YlIn -+
x~ + YlI, so that

8(xa

+ y(3) =

lim

T(x~n

+ YlIn) =

x lim

T(~n)

+ Y lim T(lIn) =

x8(a)

+ y8({3).

Thus 8 is linear. Finally,
118(a)11 = lim IIT(~n)11 ~ IITlllim II~nll = !ITII· Ilall·
Thus II Til is a bound for 8, and, since 8 includes T, 11811

= II Til. 0

The above theorem has many applications, but we shall use it only once, to
obtain the Riemann integral f: J(t) dt of a continuous function J mapping a
closed interval [a, b] into a Banach space Was an extension of the trivial integral
for step functions. If W is a normed linear space and J: [a, b] -+ W is a continuous function defined on a closed interval [a, b] C IR, we might expect to be
able to define f: J(t) dt as a suitable vector in Wand to proceed with the integral
calculus of vector-valued functions of one real variable. We haven't done this
until now because we need the completeness of W to prove that the integral
exists!
At first we shall integrate only certain elementary functions called step
functions. A finite subset A of [a, b] which contains the two endpoints a and b

4.10

THE INTEGRAL OF A PARAMETRIZED AHC

237

will be called a partition of [a, b). Thus A is (the range of) some finite sequence
{ti}o,wherea= to < tl < ... < tn = b,andAsubdivides[a, b) into a sequence
of smaller intervals. To be definite, we shall take the open intervals (ti-b ti),
i = 1, ... , n, as the intervals of the subdivision. If A and B are partitions and
A C B, we shall say that B is a j·efinement of A. Then each interval (Sj-b Sj) of
the B-subdivision is included in an interval (ti-b ti) of the A-subdivision; ti-l
is the largest element of A which is less than or equal to Sj-b and ti is the smallest
greater than or equal to Sj. A step function is simply a map f: [a, b) ---t W which
is constant on the intervals of some subdivision A = {t i} 0· That is, thE'J'e exists
a sequence of vectors {aiH such that f(~) = ai when ~ E (ii-b ti). The values
of f at the subdividing points may be among these values or they may be different.
For each step function f we define f: f(t) dt as Li'= 1 ai Ilti, where f = ai on
(t;-b ti) and Ilti = ti - ti_l. If f were real-valued, this would be simply the
sum of the areas of the rectangles making up the region between the graph of f
and the t-axis. Now f may be described as a step function in terms of many
different subdivisions. For example, if f is constant on the intervals of A, and
if we obtain B from A by adding one new point s, then f is constant on the
(smaller) intervals of B. We have to be sure that the value of the integral of f
doesn't change when we change the describing subdivision. In the case just
mentioned this is easy to see. The one new point slies in some interval (ti-l, ti),
defined by the partition A. The contribution of this interval to the A-sum is
ai(ti - ti_l), while in the B-sum it splits into ai(ti - s)
ai(s - ti_l). But
this is the same vector. The remaining summands are the same in the two sums,
and the integral is therefore unchanged. In general, suppose that f is a step
function with respect to A and also with respect to C. Set B = A U C, the
"common refinement" of A and C. We can pass from A to B in a sequence of
steps at each of which we add one new point. As we have seen, the integral
remains unchanged at each of these steps, and so it is the same for A as for B.
It is similarly the same for C and B, and so for A and C. We have thus shown
that f: f is independent of the subdivision used to define f.
Now fix [a, b) and W, and let e be the set of all step functions from [a, b)
to W. Then e is a vector space. For, if f and gin e are step functions relative to
partitions A and B, then both functions are constant on the intervals of C =
A u B, and therefore xf yg is also. Moreover, if C = {ti} 0, and if on (ti-b ti)
we havef = ai and g = (3;, so that xf yg = xai y{3i there, then the equation

we use on S the uniform norm defined from the norm of W, then the linear
mapping I ~ f; f is bounded by (b - a). If W is complete, this transformation
therefore has a unique bounded linear extension to the closure S of S in
(B([a, b], W) by Theorem 10.1. But we can show that S includes the space
e([a, b], W) of all continuous functions from [a, b] to W, and the integral of a

That is, given E>o, there exists 15>0 such that !s - tl < 15 => IIf(s) - I(t) II < E.
Now take any partition A = {ti} 0on [a, b] such that Ati = ti - ti-l < 15 for all

Our main theorem is a recapitulation.

setting J(f) = lim fn, where Un} is any sequence in S converging to f

THE COMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEM

The complex number system C is the third basic number field that must be
studied, after the rational numbers and the real numbers, and the reader surely
has had some contact with it in the past.
Almost everybody views a complex number ~ as being equivalent to a pair
of real numbers, the "real and imaginary parts" of ~, and the complex number
system C is thus viewed as being Cartesian 2-space ~ 2 with some further struc-

4.11

THE COMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEM

ture. In particular, a complex-valued function is simply a certain kind of vectorvalued function, and is equivalent to an ordered pair of real-valued functions,
again its real and imaginary parts.
What distinguishes the complex number system C from its vector substratum
1R2 is the presence of an additional operation, complex multiplication. The
vector operations of 1R2 together with this complex multiplication operation
make C into a commutative algebra. Moreover, it turns out that -< 1, 0>- is the
unique multiplicative identity in C and that every nonzero complex number ~
has a multiplicative inverse. These additional facts are summarized by saying
that C is a field, and they allow us to use C as a new scalar field in vector space
theory. In fact, the whole development of Chapters 1 and 2 remains valid when
IR is replaced everywhere by Co Scalar multiplication is now multiplication by
complex numbers. Thus c n is the vector space of ordered n-tuples of complex
numbers -< ~l! ... , ~n >-, and the product of an n-tuple by a complex scalar ex.
is defined by ex.-< ~l! ... ' ~n>- = -<ex.~l! ... ' ex.~n>-' where ex.~i is complex
multiplication.
It is time to come to grips with complex multiplication. As the reader probably knows, it is given by an odd looking formula that is motivated by thinking
of an element ~ = -<Xl! X2>- as being in the form Xl + iX2' where i 2 = -1,
and then using the ordinary laws of algebra. Then we have
~."

+ ix 2)(YI + iY2)
= XIYI + iXIY2 + iX2YI + i2X2Y2 =
=

(Xl

(XIYI -

X2Y2)

+ i(XIY2 + X2Yl),

and thus our definition is

-< Xl, X2>- -< YI, Y2>- = -< XIYI

-

X2Y2, XIY2

+ X2YI >-.

Of course, it has to be verified that this operation is commutative and satisfies
the laws for an algebra. A straightforward check is possible but dull, and we
shall indicate a neater way in the exercises.
The mapping X ~ -< X, 0>- is an isomorphic injection of the field IR into the
field C. It clearly preserves sums, and the reader can check in his mind that it
also preserves products. It is conventional to identify X with its image -< x, 0>- ,
and so to view IR as a subfield of C.
The mysterious i can be identified in C as the pair -< 0, 1>-, since then
i 2 = -<0,1>- -<0,1>- = -< -1,0>-, which we have identified with -1. With
these identifications we have -< x, y>- = -< X, 0>- + -< 0, y>- = -< X, 0>- +
-< 0, 1>- -< y, 0>- = X + iy, and this is the way we shall write complex numbers
from now on.
The mapping X + iy ~ X - iy is a field isomorphism of C with itself.
That is, it preserves both sums and products, as the reader can easily check.
Such a self-isomorphism is called an automorphism. The above automorphism is
called complex conjugation, and the image X - iy of r = X + iy is called the
conjugate of r, and is designated
We shall ask the reader to show in an exercise

r.

242

4.11

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

that conjugation is the only automorphism of C (except the identity automorphism) which leaves the elements of the subfield IR fixed.
The Euclidean norm of r = x
iy = -< x, y>- is called the absolute value
of r, and is designated Irl, so that Irl = Ix
iyl = (x 2 y2)1/2. This is
reasonable beeause it then turns out that Ipl = Irll'Yl. This can be verified by
squaring and multiplying, but it is much more elegant first to notice the relationship between absolute value and the conjugation automorphism, namely,

+

+

+

rf = Irl 2
[(x+iy)(x - iy) = x 2 - (iy) 2= X 2 +y2]. Then Ipl2 = (p)(p) = (rf)('Y'Y) =
IrI 21'Y1 2, and taking square roots gives us our identity. The identity rf = Irl 2
also shows us that if r ~ 0, then fll rl 2is its multiplicative inverse.
Because the real number system IR is a subfield of the complex number
system C, any vector space over C is automatically also a vector space over IR:
multiplication by complex scalars includes multiplication by real scalars. And
any complex linear transformation between complex vector spaces is automatically real linear. The converse, of course, does not hold. For example, a
real linear mapping T from 1R2 to 1R2 is not in general complex linear from C to C,
nor does a real linear S in Hom 1R4 become a complex linear mapping in Hom C 2
when 1R4 is viewed as C 2 • We shall study this question in the exercises.
The complex differentiability of a mapping F between complex vector spaces
has the obvious definition llF", = T
where T is complex linear, and then
F is also real differentiable, in view of the above remarks. But F may be real
differentiable without being complex differentiable. It follows from the discussion at the end of Section 8 that if {an} C C and {la n I5 n} is bounded, then the
series L anr n converges on the ball Ba(O) in the (real) Banach algebra C, and
F(r) = La anr n is real differentiable on this ball, with dFIl(r) = (L~ na n(3n)r =
F'«(3) . r But multiplication by F'«(3) is obviously a complex linear operation
on the one-dimensional complex vector space Co Therefore, complex-valued
functions defined by convergent complex power series are automatically complex differentiable. But we can go even further. In this case, if r ~ 0, we can
divide by r in the defining equation

+ ('),

to get the result that

llFIlW ~ F'«(3)

r

as

r~o.

That is, F'«(3) is now an honest derivative again, with the complex infinitesimal r
in the denominator of the difference quotient.
The consequences of complex differentiability are incalculable, and we shall
mostly leave them as future pleasures to be experienced in a course on functions
of complex variables. See, however, the problems on the residue calculus at the
end of Chapter 12 and the proof in Chapter 11, Exercise 4.3, of the following
fundamental theorem of algebra.

Theorem. Every polynomial with complex coefficients is a product of
linear factors.
A weaker but equivalent statement is that every polynomial has at least one
(complex) root. The crux of the matter is that x 2
1 cannot be factored over jR
(i.e., it has no real root), but over C we have x 2
1 = (x
i)(x -- i), with the
two roots ± i.
For later use we add a few more words about the complex exponential function exp r = ei = LO' rn/n!. If r = x
iy, we have ei = ex + ill = eXeill , and
ei1l = LO' (iy)n/n! = (1 - y2/2! +y4/4! - ... ) +i(y - y3/3!+ yS/5! - ... ) =
cos y i sin y. Thus ex + i1l = eX(cos y i sin y). That is, the real and imaginary
parts of the complex-valued function exp (x

respectively.

*12. WEAK METHODS

Our theorem that all norms are equivalent on a finite-dimensional space suggests
that the limit theory of such spaces should be accessible independently of norms,
and our earlier theorem that every linear transformation with a finite-dimensional domain is automatically bounded reinforces this impression. We shall look
into this question in this section. In a sense this effort is irrelevant, since we
can't do without norms completely, and since they are so handy that we use
them even when we don't have to.
Roughly speaking, what we are going to do is to study a vector-valued map F
by studying the whole collection of real-valued maps (l 0 F : 1 E V*) .
Theorem 12.1. If V is finite-dimensional, then ~n ~ ~ in V (with respect to
any, and so every, norm) if and only if lan) ~ l(~) in IR for each 1 in V*.
Proof. If ~n ~ ~ and 1 E V*, then l(~n) ~ l(~), since 1 is automatically continuous. Conversely, if l(~n) ~ l(~) for every 1 in V*, then, choosing a basis
{tli}~ for V, we have Ei(~n) ~ Ei(~) for each functional Ei in the dual basis, and
this implies that ~n ~ ~ in the associated one-norm, since I! ~n - ~!! 1 =
L~ IEi(~n) - Ei(~)1 ~ o. 0
Remark. If V is an arbitrary normed linear space, so that V* = Hom(V, IR)
is the set of bounded linear functionals, then we say that ~n ~ ~ weakly if
l(~n) ~ l(~) for each 1 E V*. The above theorem can therefore be rephrased to
Ray that in a finite-dimensional space, weak convergence and norm convergence are
equivalent notions.

We shall now see that in a similar way the integration and differentiation of
parametrized arcs can all be thrown back to the standard calculus of real-valued
functions of a real variable by applying functionals from V* and using the
natural isomorphism of V** with V. Thus, if f E e([a, b], V) and X E V*, then

If F(x) =
f, then (A 0 F)(x) =
A 0 f by the weak definition of tlw
integral. The fundamental theorem of the standard calculus then says thai
(A 0 F)' exists and (A 0 F)'(x) = (A 0 f) (x) = A(j(X)). By the weak definition 01
the derivative we then have that F' exists and F'(x) = f(x).
The one conclusion that we don't get so easily by weak methods is the nOflll

It follows from (a) and (b) that a semiscalar product is also linear in the
second variable when the first variable is held fixed, and therefore is a symmetric
bilinear functional whose associated quadratic form q(~) = (~, ~) is positive
definite or positive semidefinite [(c) or (c /); see the last section in Chapter 2].
The definiteness of the form q has far-reaching consequences, as we shall begin

is valid for any semiscalar product.

Proof. We have 0 ~ (~ - t1], ~ - t1]) = (~, ~) - 2t(~, 1])

t E~. Since this quadratic in t is never negative, it cannot have distinct roots,
and the usual (b 2 - 4ac)-formula implies that 4(~, 1])2 - 4(~, ~)(1], 1]) ~ 0,
which is equivalent to the Schwarz inequality. 0
We can also proceed directly. If (1], 1]) > 0, and if we set t = (~, 1])/(1], 1])
in the quadratic inequality in the first line of the proof, then the resulting
expression simplifies to the Schwarz inequality. If (1], 1]) = 0, then (~, 1]) must
also be 0 (or else the beginning inequality is clearly false for some t), and now
the Schwarz inequality holds trivially.

SCALAR PRODUCT SPACES

The two examples of scalar products mentioned earlier give us the real explanation of our two-norms for the first time:
n

\lxl12 = ( ~ x~

)1/2

for

x E IR n

and
for

IE e([a, b])

are scalar product norms.
Since the scalar product norm on IR n becomes Euclidean length under a
Cartesian coordinate correspondence with Euclidean n-space, it is conventional
to call IR n itself Euclidean n-space IP when we want it understood that thp
scalar product norm is being used.
Any finite-dimensional space V is a Hilbert space with respect to any scalar
product norm, because its finite dimensionality guarantees its completeness.
On the other hand, we shall see in Exercise 1.10 that e([a, b]) is incomplete in th('
two-norm, and is therefore a pre-Hilbert space but not a Hilbert space in this
norm. (Remember, however, that e([a, b]) is complete in the uniform norm
11111",.) It is important to the real uses of Hilbert spaces in mathematics that any
pre-Hilbert space can be completed to a Hilbert space, but the theory of infinitedimensional Hilbert spaces is for the most part beyond the scope of this book.
Scalar product norms have in some sense the smoothest possible unit
spheres, because these spheres are quadratic surfaces.
It is orthogonality that gives the theory of pre-Hilbert spaces its special
flavor. Two vectors a and fJ are said to be orthogonal, written a 1- fJ, if (a, fJ) = O.
This definition gets its inspiration from geometry; we noted in Chapter 1 that
two geometric vectors are perpendicular if and only if their coordinate triples x
and y satisfy (x, y) = O. It is an interesting problem to go further and to show
from the law of cosines (c 2 = a 2 b2 - 2ab cos (J) that the angle (J between two
geometric vectors is given by (x, y) = Ilxllllyll cos (J. This would motivate us
to define the angle (J between two vectors ~ and 'I] in a pre-Hilbert space by
(~, '1]) = II ~IIII'I]II cos (J, but we shall have no use for this more general formulation.
We say that two subsets A and B are orthogonal, and we write A 1- B, if
a 1- fJ for every a in A and fJ in B; for any subset A we set A 1- = {fJ E V: fJ 1- A J .

+

Lemma 1.1. If fJ is orthogonal to the set A, then fJ is orthogonal to L(A), tlw

closure of the linear span of A. It follows that B1- is a closed subspace for
every subset B.
Proof. The first assertion depends on the linearity and continuity of the scalar
product in one of its variables; it will be left to the reader. As for A = B1-, it
includes the closure of its own linear span, by the first part, and so is a closed
subspace. 0

2. ORTHOGONAL PROJECTION

One of the most important devices in geometric reasoning is "dropping a perpendicular" from a point to a line or a plane and then using right triangh·
arguments. This device is equally important in pre-Hilbert space theory. If M
is a subspace and a is any element in V, then by "the foot of the perpendicular
dropped from a to M" we mean that vector J.L in M such that (a - J.L) 1- 111,
if such a J.L exists. (See Fig. 5.1.) Writing a as J.L + (a - J.L), we see that tllP
existence of the "foot" J.L in JIll for each a in V is equivalent to the direct sum decomposition V = M $ M 1-.
N ow it is precisely this direct sum decomposition
that the completeness of a Hilbert space guarantees,
as we shall shortly see. We start by proving the
geometrically intuitive fact that J.L is the foot of the
111
perpendicular dropped from a to M if and only if J.L
t
I ig.5.1
is the point in M closest to a.
Lemma 2.1. If J.L is in the subspace M, then (a - J.L) 1- M if and only' if J.L is
the unique point in M closest to a, that is, J.L is the "best approximation" to
a in M.

Proof. If (a - J.L) 1- M and ~ is any other point in M, then

Therefore, (a - JJ.) .1. M. 0

+

On the basis of this lemma it is clear that a way to look for JJ. is to take a
sequence JJ.n in M such that Iia - JJ.nll --t p(a, M) and to hope to define JJ. as its
limit. Here is the crux of the matter: We can prove that such a sequence {JJ.n} is
always Cauchy, but its limit may not exist if M is not complete!
Lemma 2.2. If {JJ.n} is a sequence in the subspace M whose distance from
some vector a converges to the distance p from a to M, then {JJ.n} is Cauchy.

Proof. By the parallelogram law, IIJJ.n - JJ.m11 2 = II(a - JJ.n) - (a - JJ.m)112 =
2(lla - JJ.n11 2 Iia - JJ.mI1 2) - 112a - (JJ.n

Theorem 2.1. If M is a complete subspace of a pre-Hilbert space V, then

If V = M ED M-L, then the projection on M along Ml. is called the orthogonal
projection on M, or simply the projection on M, since among all the projections on
M associated with the various complements of M, the orthogonal projection is
distinguished. Thus, if M is a complete subspace of V, and if P is the projection
on M, then P(~) is at once the foot of the perpendicular dropped from ~ to M
(which is where the word "projection" comes from) and also the best approximation to ~ in M (Lemma 2.1).
Lemma 2.3. If {MiH is a finite collection of complete, pairwise orthogonal

subspaces, and if for a vector a in V, ai is the projection of a on "Ali for
i = 1, ... , n, then L~ ai is the projection of a on EB~ Mi.
Proof. We have to show that a - L~ ai is orthogonal to EB~ Mj, and it is
sufficient to show it orthogonal to each M j separately. But if ~ E Mj, then
(a - L~ ai, ~) = (a - aj, ~), since (ai, ~) = 0 for i ~ j, and (a - aj, ~) = 0
because aj is the projection of a on M j. Thus (a - L~ ai, ~) = O. 0

{Xin are the corresponding Fourier coefficients of a vector ~, then L~ Xi'Pi is thl'
projection of ~ on the subspace M spanned by {'Pi} ~. Therefore, ~ - L~ Xi'Pi -L M.

If an orthogonal set of vectors {'Pi} is also normalized (lI'Pill = 1), then we

V = M, and, by the theorem, this holds if and only if {lPi} is a basis. 0

Note that when orthogonal bases only are being used, the coefficient of a
vector ~ at a basis element {3 is always the Fourier coefficient (~, (3)/11{3112.
Thus the {3-coefficient of ~ depends only on {3 and is independent of the choice
of the rest of the basis. However, we know from Chapter 2 that when an arbitrary basis containing {3 is being used, then the {3-coefficient of ~ varies with the
basis. This partly explains the favored position of orthogonal bases.
We often obtain an orthonormal sequence by "orthogonalizing" some given
sequence.
Lemma 2.5. If {ai} is a finite or infinite sequence of independent vectors,
then there is an orthonormal sequence {lPi} such that {ai}! and {lPi}'~,have
the same linear span for all n.
Proof. Since normalizing is trivial, we shall only orthogonalize. Suppose, to be
definite, that the sequence is infinite, and let M n be the linear span of
{aI, ... , an}. Let JLn be the orthogonal projection of an on M n-l, and set
IPn = an - JLn (and IPI = al). This is our sequence. We halVe lPi E Mi C M n-l
if i < n, and IPn 1. M n-l, so that the vectors lPi are mutually orthogonal.
Also, IPn ~ 0, since an is not in M n _ l . Thus {lPi}! is an independent subset of
the n-dimensional vector space M n, by the corollary of Lemma 1.2, and so
{lPi}! spans Mn. 0

The actual calculation of the orthogonalized sequence {lPn} can be carried
out recursively, starting with IPI = ab by noticing that since JLn is the projection
of an on the span of IPI, ... , IPn-b it must be the vector L:~-l CilPi, where ci.is
the Fourier coefficient of an with respect to lPi.
Consider, for example, the sequence {xn} 0' in e([O, 1]). We have IPI =
al = 1. Next, 1P2 = a2 - JL2 = X - c· 1, where
C = (a2, IPI)/[IIPI[[2 = fol x·

Theorem 2.4. () is an isomorphism if and only if V is a Hilbert space.
Proof. Suppose first that V is a Hilbert space. We have to show that () is surjective, i.e., that every nonzero F in V* is of the form ()p. Given such an F, let N
be its null space, let a be a vector orthogonal to N (Theorem 2.1), and consider
(3 = ca, where c is to be determined later. Every vector ~ in V is uniquely a sum
~ = x{3 + 1/, where 1/ is in N. [This only says that V IN is one-dimensional, which

3. SELF-ADJOINT TRANSFORMATIONS
Definition. If V is a pre-Hilbert space, then T in Hom V is self-adjoint if
(Ta, (3) = (a, T(3) for every a, {3 E V. The set of all self-adjoint transforma-

tions will be designated SA.
Self-adjointness suggests that T ought to become its own adjoint under the
injection of V into V*. We check this now. Since (a, (3) = OfJ(a) , we can rewrite
the equation (Ta,{3) = (a, T(3) as OfJ(Ta) = OTtI(a), and again as (T*(0tl)(a) = t,(TrI.)
~ by the definition of T*. This holds for all a and (3 if and only if T*(OfJ) =
OTfJ for all (3 E V, or T* 0 = 0 T, which is the asserted identification.

Lemma 3.1. If V is a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and {<Pi}~ is an
orthonormal basis for V, then T E Hom(V) is self-adjoint if and only if the
matrix {tij} of T with respect to {<Pi} is symmetric (t = t*).
Proof. If we substitute the basis expansions of a and {3 and expand, we see that
(a, T(3) = (Ta, (3) for all a and {3 if and only if (<Pi, T<pj) = (T<pi, <pj) for all i
and j. But T<P1 = Lk=l tkl<Pk, and when this is substituted in these last scalar
products, the equation becomes tij = tji. That is, T is self-adjoint if and only if
t = t*. 0

If a ~ 0 and T(a) = Ca for some c, then a is called an eigenvector (proper
vector, characteristic vector) of T, and c is the associated eigenvalue (proper
value, characteristic value).

Theorem 3.1. If V is a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and T is a selfadjoint element of Hom V, then V has an orthonormal basis consisting
entirely of eigenvectors of T.
Proof. Consider the function (T~, ~). It is a continuous real-valued function
of ~, and on the unit sphere S = {~: II~II = I} it is bounded above by IITII
(by Schwarz). Set m = lub {(TI;,~): II~II = I}. Since S is compact (being
bounded and closed), (T~, ~) assumes the value m at some point a on S. Now
m - T is a nonnegative self-adjoint transformation (Check this!), and (Ta, a) =
m is equivalent to ((m - T)a, a) = o. Therefore, (m - T)a = 0 by Lemma
3.2, and Ta = ma. We have thus found one ~igenvector for T. Now set VI = V,
a1 = a, and m1 = m, and let V 2 be {a1} 1.. Then T[V 2] C V 2, for if I;.l all
then (T~, a1) = (~, Tal) = m(~, a1) = O.
We can therefore repeat the above argument for the restriction of T to the
Hilbert space V 2 and find a2 in V 2 such that IIa211 = 1 and T(a2) = m2a2,
where m2 = lub {(T~, ~) : II ~II = 1 and ~ E V 2J. Clearly, m2 ~ mI. We then
set V 3 = {all a2} 1. and continue, arriving finally at an orthonormal basis
{aig of eigenvectors of T. 0

Now let All •.• , AT be the distinct values in the list mil ... , m n , and let M j
be the linear span of those basis vectors ai for which mi = Aj. Then the subspaces 1I1 j are orthogonal to each other, V = E9; lIfj, each 1I1 j is T-invariant,
and the restriction of T to 1I1 j is Aj times the identity. Since all the nonzero
vectors in 1I1j are eigenvectors with eigenvalue Aj, if the a/s spanning ]lI j are
replaced by any other orthonormal basis for AI j, then we still have an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. The a/s are therefore not in general uniquely
determined. But the subspaces 1I1 j and the eigenvalues Aj are unique. This will
follow if we show that every eigenvector is in an ]lI j .
Lemma 3.3. In the context of the above discussion, if ~ ~ 0 and T(I;) =
for some x in IR, then ~ E 1I1j (and so x = Aj) for some j.

We have thus proved the following theorem.
Theorelll 3.2. If V is a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and T is a self-

adjoint element of Hom V, then there are uniquely determined subspaces
{Vi}; of V, and distinct scalars {Xi};, such that {Vi} is an orthogonal
family whose sum is V and the restriction of T to Vi is Xi times the identity.
If V is a finite-dimensional vector space and we are given T E Hom V, then
we know how to compute related mappings such as T2 and T- 1 (if it exists)
and vectors Ta, T-1a, etc., by choosing a basis for V and then computing matrix
products, inverses (when they exist), and so on. Some of these computations,
particularly those related to inverses, can be quite arduous. One enormous
advantage of a basis consisting of eigenvectors for T is that it trivializes all of
these calculations.
To see this, let {i3n} be a basis of V consisting entirely of eigenvectors for T,
and let {rn} be the corresponding eigenvalues. To compute T~, we write down
the basis expansion for ~, ~ = L~ Xii3i, and then T~ = L~ rixii3i. T2 has the
same eigenvectors, but with eigenvalues {rl}. Thus T 2 a = L~ rlxii3i. T- 1
exists if and only if no ri = 0, in which case it has the same eigenvectors with
eigenvalues {l/ri}. Thus T- 1 ~ = L~ (x;jri)i3i. If P(t) = L~ ant n is any
polynomial, then P(T) takes i3i into P(ri)i3i. Thus P(T) ~ = L~ P(ri)xii3i.
By now the point should be amply clear.
The additional value of orthonormality in a basis is already clear fom the
last section. Basically, it enables us to compute the coefficients {Xi} of ~ by
scalar products: Xi = (~, i3i).
This is a good place to say a few words about the general eigenvalue problem
in finite-dimensional theory. Our complete analysis above was made possible by
the self-adjointness of T (or the symmetry of the matrix t). What we can say
about an arbitrary T in Hom V is much less satisfactory.
We first note that the eigenvalues of T can be determined algebraically, for X
is an eigenvalue if and only if T - XI is not injective, or, equivalently, is singular, and we know that T - XIis singular ifand only if its determinant .1(T - XI)
is O. If we choose any basis for V, the determinant of T - XI is the determinant
of its matrix t - Xe, and our later formula in Chapter 7 shows that this is a
polynomial of degree n in X. It is easy to see that this polynomial is independent
of the basis; it is called the characteristic polynomial of T. Thus the eigenvalues
of T are exactly the roots of the characteristic polynomial of T.

However, T need not have any eigenvectors! Consider, for example, a 90
rotation in the Cartesian plane. This is the map T: -< x, y> f-4 -< -y, x> .

Then the matrix of T - A is

[~ -~l

and the characteristic polynomial of T is the determinant of this matrix: A2
1.
Since this polynomial is irreducible over IR, there are no eigenvalues.
Note how different the outcome is if we consider the transformation with the
same matrix on complex 2-space (:2. Here the scalar field is the complex number
system, and T is the map -< z}, Z2> f-4 -< -Z2, Zl > from (:2 to (:2. But now
>-.2
1 = (>-.
i)(>-' - i), and T has eigenvalues ±i! To find the eigenvectors
for i, we solve T(z) = iz, which is the equation -< -Z2, Zl > = -< iz}, iz 2 > , or
Z2 = -iz l . Thus -<1, -i> (or i-<l, -i> = -<i, 1» is the unique eigenvector for i to within a scalar multiple.
We return to our real theory. If T E Hom V and n = d(V), so that
d(Hom V) = n 2 , then the set of n 2
1 vectors {T i 2 in Hom V is dependent.
But this is exactly the same as saying that p(T) = 0 for some polynomial p of
degree ~n2. That is, any T in Hom V satisfies a polynomial identity p(T) = O.
Now suppose that T is an eigenvalue of T and that TW = T~. Then p(T)(O =
p(/') ~ === 0, and so p(r) = O. That is, every eigenvalue of T is a root of the
polynomial p. Conversely, if p(r) = 0, then we know from the remainder
theorem of algebra that t - l' is a factor of the polynomial p(t), and therefore
(t - 1')1n will be one of the relatively prime factors of p. Now suppose that p is
the minimal polynomial of T (see Exercise 3.5). Theorem 5.5, Chapter 1, tells
us that (T - 1'I)m is zero on a corresponding subspace N of V and therefore, in
particular, that T - rl is not injective when restricted to N. That is, l' is an
eigenvalue. We have proved:

Theorem 3.3. The eigenvalues of T are zeros (roots) of every polynomial

by the carresP.onding transfarmatian 0- 1 0 T* 0 0 E Ham V. In Hilbert space

Then, exactly as in .our discussi.on .of a self-adjaint T, we see that

= {tii} be a symmetric n X n matrix. Then there
exists an orthogonal n X n matrix b such that b- 1tb is a diagonal matrix.

Theorelll 4.2. Let t

Proof. Since the transformation T E Hom IR n defined by t is self-adjoint, there
exists an orthonormal basis {bi} i of eigenvectors of T, with corresponding
eigenvalues {ri}i. Let B be the orthogonal transformation defined by B(~i) =
bi, j = 1, ... ,n. (The n-tuples b i are the columns of the matrix b = {bii}
of B.) Then (B- 1 0 T 0 B)(~i) = ri~i. Since (B- 1 0 T 0 B)(~i) is the jth
column of b- 1tb, we see that s = b- 1 tb is diagonal, with 8ji = rj. 0

For later applications we are also going to want the following result.
Theorelll 4.3. Any invertible T E Hom V on a finite-dimensional Hilbert
space V can be expressed in the form T = RS, where R is orthogonal and S
is self-adjoint and positive.

Proof. For any T, T*T is self-adjoint, since (T*T)* = T*T** = T*T. Let
{'Pi}i be an orthonormal eigenbasis, and let {ri}i be the corresponding eigenvalues of T*T. Then 0 < II T'Pi1l 2 = (T*T'Pi, tpi) = (ritpi, 'Pi) = ri for each i.
Since all the eigenvalues of T*T are thus positive, we can define a positive square
root S = (T*T)1/2 by Stpi = (ri)1/2tpi, i = 1,2, ... ,n. It is clear that S2 =
T*T and that S is self-adjoint.
Then A = ST- 1 is orthogonal, for (ST- 1a, ST- 1fJ) = (T- 1a, S2T- 1fJ) =
(T- 1a, T*TT- 1fJ) = (T- 1a, T*fJ) = (TT- 1a, fJ) = (a, fJ). Since T = A -IS,
we set R = A-I and have the theorem. 0

It is not hard to see that the above factorization of T is unique. Also, by
starting with TT*, we can express T in the form T = SR, where S is self-adjoint
and positive and R is orthogonal.
We call these factorizations the polar decompositions of T, since they function somewhat like the polar coordinate factorization z = rei8 of a complex
number.
Corollary. Any nonsingular n X n matrix t can be expressed as t = udv,
where u and v are orthogonal and d is diagonal.

Proof. From the theorem we have t = rs, where r is orthogonal and s is symmetric. By Theorem 4.2, s = bdb-l, where d is diagonal and b is orthogonal.
Thus t = rs = (rb)db- 1 = udv, where u = rb and v = b- 1 are both
orthogonal. 0

5. COMPACT TRANSFORMATIONS

Theorem 3.1 breaks down when V is an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.
A self-adjoint transformation T does not in general have enough eigenvectors
to form a basis for V, and a more sophisticated analysis, allowing for a "continuous spectrum" as well as a "discrete spectrum", is necessary. This enriched situation is the reason for the need for further study of Hilbert space
theory at the graduate level, and is one of the sources of complexity in the
mathematical structure of quantum mechanics.
"
However,
there is one very important special case in which the eigenbasis
theorem is available, and which will have a startling application in the next
chapter.
Definition. Let V and W be any normed linear spaces, and let S be the unit

ball in V. A transformation T in Hom(V, W) is compact if the closure of
T[S] in W is sequentially compact.
TheoreID 5.1. Let V be any pre-Hilbert space, and let T E Hom V be selfadjoint and compact. Then the pre-Hilbert space R = range (T) has an

orthonormal basis {\oi} consisting entirely of eigenvectors of T, and the
corresponding sequence of eigenvalues {rn} converges to 0 (or is finite).
Proof. The proof is just like that of Theorem 3.1 except that we have to start a
little differently. Set m = IITII = lub {IIT(~)II : II ~II = I}, and choose a sequence Hn} such that II ~n II = 1 for all n and I T( ~n) I ---? m. Then

and since m 2 - T2 is a nonnegative self-adjoint transformation, Lemma 3.2
tells that (m 2 - T2)(~n) -7 O. But since T is compact, we can suppose (passing
to a subsequence if necessary) that {T ~n} converges, say to fj. Then T2 ~n -7 Tfj,
and so m2~n -7 Tfj also. Thus ~n -7 Tfj/m 2 and fj = lim T~n = T2(fj)/m 2
Since Ilfjll = lim IIT(~n)1I = m, we have a nonzero vector fj such that T2(fj) =
m 2 fj. Set a = fj/llfjll.
We have thus found a vector a such that Iiall = 1 and 0 = (m 2 - T2)(a) =
(m - T)(m + T)(a). Then either (m + T)(a) = 0, in which case T(a) =
-ma, or (m + T)(a) = 'Y ¢ 0 and (m - T)'Y = 0, in which case T'Y = m'Y.
Thus there exists a vector 'PI (a or 'Y /II'YII) such that II'PIII = 1 and T('PI) =
rl'PI, where hi = m. We now proceed just as in Theorem 3.I.
For notational consistency we set mi = m, V I = V, and now set V 2 =
{'PI} 1.. Then T[V2] C V 2, since if a.i 'Pb then (Ta, 'PI) = (a, T'P2) =
rl(a, 'PI) = O. Thus T V 2is compact and self-adjoint, and if m2 = liT V 211,
there exists 'P2 with 11'P211 = 1 and T('P2) = r2'P2, where Ir21 = m2. We continue
inductively, obtaining an orthonormal sequence {'Pn} C V and a sequence
{rn} C IR such that T'Pn = rn'Pn and Irnl = liT r V nil, where

r

Vn =

{'Pb ... , 'Pn_l}l..

We suppose for the moment, since this is the most interesting case, that
rn ¢ 0 for all n.- Then we claim that Irnl -7 O. For Irnl is decreasing in any case,
and if it does not converge to 0, then there exists a b > 0 such that Irnl ~ b
for all n. Then IIT('Pi) - T('Pj)11 2 = Ilri'Pi - rj'Pj112 = "1Iri'PiI12 + Ilrj'Pjl12 =
ri2 + r; ~ 2b 2 for all i ¢ j, and the sequence {T('Pi)} can have no convergent
subsequence, contradicting the compactness of T. Therefore Irnll O.
Finally, we have to show that the orthonormal sequence {'Pi} is a basis for R.
If fj = T(a), and if {b n} and {an} are the Fourier coefficients of fj and a,
then we expect that bn = rna n, and this is easy to check: bn = (fj, 'Pn) =
(T(a), 'Pn) = (a, T('Pn)) = (a, rn'Pn) = rn(a, 'Pn) = rnan. This is just saying
that T(an'Pn) = bn'Pn' and therefore fj - L~ bi'Pi = T(a - L~ ai'Pi). Now
a - L~ ai'Pi is orthogonal to {'Pi}~ and therefore is an element of V n+b and the
norm of T on V n+l is Irn+ll. Moreover, Iia - L~ ai'Pili ~ lIall, by the Pythagorean theorem. Altogether we can conclude that

and since rn+1 -70, this implies that fj = Li bi'Pi. 'Thus {'Pi} is a basis for
R(T). Also, since T is self-adjoint, N(T) = R(T)l. = {'Pi} 1. =

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

This chapter is not a small differential equations textbook; we leave out far too
much. We are principally concerned with some of the theory of the subject,
although we shall say one or two practical things. Our first goal is the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem of ordinary differential equations,
which we prove as an elegant application of the fixed-point theorem. Next we
look at the linear theory, where we make vital use of material from the first two
chapters and get quite specific about the process of actually finding solutions.
So far our development is linked to the initial-value problem, concerning the
existence of, and in some cases the ways of finding, a unique solution passing
through some initially prescribed point in the space containing the solution
curves. However, some of the most important aspects of the subject relate to
what are called boundary-value problems, and our last and most sophisticated
effort will be directed toward making a first step into this large area. This will
involve us in the theory of Chapter 5, for we shall find ourselves studying selfadjoint operators. In fact, the basic theorem about Fourier series expansion:;;
will come out of recognizing a certain right inverse of a differential operator to be
a compact self-adjoint operator.
1. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

Let A be an open subset of a Banach space W, let I be an open interval in IR, and
let F: I X A ~ W be continuous. We want to study the differential equation

dOi/dt = F(t, (1).
A solution of this equation is a function!: J
of I, such that f' (t) exists and

~

A, where J is an open subinterval

f' (t) = F (t, f(t))
for every t in J. Note that a solution f has to be continuously differentiable, for
the existence of f' implies the continuity of f, and then f' (t) = F (t, f( t)) is
continuous by the continuity of F.
Weare going to see that if F has a continuous second partial differential,
then there exists a uniquely determined "local" solution through any point

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

267

In saying that the solution f goes through < to, ao > , we mean, of course, that
ao = f(t o). The requirement that the solution f have the value ao when t = to
is called an initial condition.
The existence and continuity of dF~t.a> implies, via the mean-value
theorem, that F(t, a) is locally uniformly Lipschitz in a. By this we mean that
for any point < to, ao> in I X A there is a neighborhood M X N and a constant
b such that IIF(t, ~) - F(t, '17)11 ::::; bll ~ - '1711 for all t in M and all ~, '17 in N.
To see this we simply choose balls M and N about to and ao such that dF~I.a> is
bounded, say by b, on M X N, and apply Theorem 7.4 of Chapter 3. This is the
condition that we actually use below.
Let A be an open subset of a Banach space W, let I be an
open interval in IR, and let F be a continuous mapping from I X A to W
which is locally uniformly Lipschitz in its second variable. Then for any
point <to, ao> in I X A, for some neighborhood U of ao and for any
sufficiently small interval J containing to, there is a unique function f from
J to U which is a solution of the differential equation passing through the
point < to, ao> .
Theorelll 1.1.

Proof. If f is a solution on J through
f(t) - f(t o) =

< to, ao> , then an integration gives

r

l

110

F(s,f(s)) ds,

so that

f(t)

= ao + r t F(s,f(s)) ds
lto

for t E J. Conversely, if f satisfies this "integral equation", then the fundamental theorem of the calculus implies that !'(t) exists and equals F(t,f(t))
on J, so thatfis a solution of the differential equation which clearly goes through
< to, ao>. Now for any continuous f: J ---7 A we can define g: J ---7 W by

g(t) = ao

+ ltort F(s,f(s)) ds,

and our argument above shows that f is a solution of the differential equation if
and only if f is a fixed point of the mapping K: f f---+ g. This suggests that we try
to show that K is a contraction, so that we can apply the fixed-point theorem.
We start by choosing a neighborhood L X U of <to, ao> on which F(t, a)
is bounded and Lipschitz in a uniformly over t. Let J be some open subinterval
of L containing to, and let V be the Banach space CJ3e(J, W) of bounded continuous functions from J to W. Our later calculation will show how small we
have to take J. We assume that the neighborhood U is a ball about ao of radius
r, and we consider the ball of functions 'U = Br(ao) in V, where ao is the constant function with value ao. Then any fin 'U has its range in U, so that F(t, f(t))
is defined, bounded, and continuous. That is, K as defined earlier maps the ball
'U into V.

From (2) we see that K is a contraction with constant C = OC if OC < 1, and

We next show that any two solutions through < to, ao>- must agree on the
intersection of their domains (under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1).

Proof. Otherwise there is a point s in J such that gl(S) ~ g2(S). Suppose that
s > to, and set C = {t: t > to and gl (t) ~ g2(t)} and x = glb C. The set C
is open, since gl and g2 are continuous, and therefore x is not in C. That is,
gl(X) = g2(X). Call this common value a and apply the theorem to <x, a>-.
With r such that Br(a) CA, we choose 0 small enough so that the differential
equation has a unique solution g from (x - 0, x
0) to Br(a) passing through
<x, a>-, and we also take 0 small enough so that the restrictions of gl and g2 to
(x - 0, x
0) have ranges in Br(a). But then gl = g2 = g on this interval
by the uniqueness of g, and this contradicts the definition of x. Therefore,
gl = g2 on the intersection of their domains. 0

point -< t l , al > near the end of such a local solution and then consider the local
solution about -< tt, al > , first of all it will have to agree with our first solution
on the intersection of the two domains, and secondly it will in general extend
farther beyond tl than the first solution, so the two local solutions will fit together
to make a solution on a larger t-interval than either gives separately. We can
continue in this way to extend our original solution to what might be called a
global solution, made up of a patchwork of matching local solutions. These
notions are somewhat vague as described above, and we now turn to a more
precise construction of a global solution.
Given -< to, ao> C I X A, let (f be the family of all solutions through
-< to, ao>. Thus g E (f if and only if g is a solution on an interval J C I, to E J,
and g(to) = ao. Lemma 1.1 shows exactly that the uniont f of all the functions g
in (f is itself a function, for if -< t l , al > E gl and -< tIl a2 > E g2, then al =
gl (t) = g2(t) = a2'
Moreover, f is a solution, because around any x in its domain f agrees with
some g E (f. By the way f was defined we see that f is the unique maximum
solution through -< to, ao>. We have thus proved the following theorem.
Theorelll 1.3. Let F: I X A ~ V be a function satisfying the hypotheses of
Theorem 1.1. Then through each -< to, ao> in I X A there is a uniquely
determined maximal solution to the differential equation dajdt = F(t, a).

In general, we would have to expect a maximal solution to "run into the
boundary of A" and therefore to have a domain interval J properly included in I,
as Fig. 6.1 suggests.

t Remember that we are taking a function to be a set of ordered pairs, so that the
union of a family of functions makes precise sense.

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

However, if A is the whole space W, and if F(t, a) is Lipsohitz in a for each t,
with a Lipschitz bound e(t) that is continuous in t, then we can show that each
maximal solution is over the whole of I. We shall shortly see that this condition
is a natural one for the linear equation.

W be a Banach space, and let I be an open interval in ~.
Let F: I X W ~ W be continuous, and suppose that there is a continuous
function e: I ~ ~ such that
Theorem 1.4. Let

for all t in I and all aI, a2 in W. Then each maximal solution to the differential equation daldt = F(t, a) has the whole of I for its domain.

Proof. Suppose, on the contrary, that g is a maximal solution whose domain
interval J has right-hand endpoint b less than that of I. We choose a finite open
interval L containing b and such that LeI (see Fig. 6.2). Since L is compact,
the continuous function e(t) has a maximum value e on L. We choose any tl
in L n J close enough to b so that b - tl < lie, and we set al = g(t l ) and
m = max IIF(t, al) lion L. With these values of e and m, and with any r, the
proof of Theorem 1.1 gives us a local solution f through -< t l , al >- with domain
(It - 5, tl
5) for any 5 less than r/(m
re) = liCe
(mlr». Since we
now have no restriction on r (because A = W), this bound on 5 becomes
lie, and since we chose tl so that tl
(lie) > b, we can now choose 5 so that
tl
5 > b. But this gives us a contradiction; the maximal solution g through
-< tt, al >- includes the local solution f, so that, in particular, tl 5 :::; b.
We have thus proved the theorem. 0

Going back to our original situation, we can conclude that if the Lipschitz
control of F is of the stronger type assumed above, and if the domain J of some
maximal solution g is less than I, then the open set A cannot be the whole of W.
It is in fact true that the distance from g(t) to the boundary of A approaches
zero as t approaches an endpoint b of J which is interior to I. That is, it is now a
theorem that p(j(t), A') ~ 0 as t ~ b. The proof is more complicated than our
argument above, and we leave it as a set of exercises for the interested reader.

6.1

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

271

A functionf: J ~ W is a solution to this equation if J is an open subinterval of
I, f has continuous derivatives on J up to the nth order, f(i-ll[J] C Ai, i =
1, ... , n, and
f(n)(t) = GCt, f(t),f'(t), . .. ,pn-ll(t))
for t E J. An initial condition is now given by a point

-<to, f3I, f32,"" f3n>- E I X Al X··· X An.
The basic theorem is almost the same as before. To simplify our notation, let a
be the n-tuple -< aI, a2, ... , a n >- in wn = V, and set A =
Ai. Also let
1/1 be the mapping f 1---+ -< f, 1', ... , f(n-I) >- . Then the solution equation
becomesf(n)(t) = GCt,1/If(t)).

In

Theorem 1.5. Let G: I X A ~ W be as above and suppose, in addition,
that G(t, a) is locally uniformly Lipschitz in a. Then for any -< to, fJ >- in
I X A and for any sufficiently small open interval J containing to, there is a
unique functionffrom J to W such thatfis a solution to the above nth-order
equation satisfying the initial condition if;f(t o) = fJ.

Proof. There is an ancient and standard device for reducing a single nth-order
equation to a system of first-order equations. The idea is to replace the single
equation
dna/dtn = G(t, a, da/dt, ... ,dn-Ia/dtn- I )
by the system of equations

daddt
da2/dt

= a2,
= aa,

dan_ddt = an,
dan/dt = G(t, aI, a2, ... , an),
and then to recognize this system as equivalent to a single first-order equation
on a different space. In fact, if we define the mapping F = -<FI, ... , F n >from I X A to V = wn by setting Fi(t, a) = ai+I for i = 1, ... , n - 1, and
Fn(t, a) = G(t, a), then the above system becomes the single equation

da/dt = F(t, a),
where F is clearly locally uniformly Lipschitz in a. Now a function f =
-<iI, ... ,fn >- from J to V is a solution of this equation if and only if
f~ =h,

f~

f~ = G(t, !I, ... , fn),

272

that is, if and only if f1 has derivatives up to order n, t/!(/I) = f and f~n\t) =
GCt, t/!/I(t). The n-tuplet initial condition 1/If(to) = fl is now just f(to) = fl.
Thus the nth-order theorem for G has turned into the first-order theorem for F,
and so follows from Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 0
The local solution through -< to, fl> extends to a unique maximal solution
by Theorem 1.3 applied to our first-order problem dot./dt = F(t, a), and the
domain of the maximal solution is the whole of I if G(t, a) is Lipschitz in a with
a bound c(t) that is continuous and if A = W n , as in Theorem 1.4.

2. DIFFERENTIABLE DEPENDENCE ON PARAMETERS

It is exceedingly important in some applications to know how the solution to the
system
f'(t) = G(t,f(t)),
varies with the initial point -< t l , al >-. In order to state the problem precisely,
we fix an open interval J, set 'U = Br(ao) C V = CBe(J, W) as in the previous
section, and require a solution in'U passing through -< h, al >- , where -< h, al >is near -< to, ao>-. Supposing that a unique solution f exists, we then have a
mapping -< tll al >- ~ f, and it is the continuity and differentiability of this map
that we wish to study.

-< to, ao>- in the Banach
space ~ X W, and let F(t, a) be a bounded continuous mapping from
L X U to W which is Lipschitz in a uniformly over t. Then there is a neighborhood J X N of -< to, ao>- with the following property. For any -< tll al >in J X N there is a unique function f from J to U which is a solution of the
differential equation da/dt = F(t, a) passing through -< t l , al >-, and the
mapping -< t l , al >- ~ f from J X N to V is continuous.
TheoreDl 2.1. Let L X U be a neighborhood of

Proof. We simply reexamine the calculation of Theorem 1.1 and take 0 a little
smaller. Let K(tll all f) be the mapping of that theorem but with initial point
-< t l , al >-, so that g = K(t l , all f) if and only if get) = al ft~ F(s, f(s)) ds for
all t in J. Clearly K is continuous in -< tl, al >- for each fixed f.
If N is the ball B r / 2 (ao), then the inequality (1) in the proof shows that
IIK(tll aI, ao) - aoll ~ lIal - aoll
om ~ r/2
om. The second inequality
remains unchanged. Therefore, f ~ K(tll aI, f) is a map from'U to V which is a
contraction with constant C = OC if OC < 1, and which moves the center ao of 'U
a distance less than (1 - C)r if r/2
om < (1 - oc)r. This new double
requirement on 0 is equivalent to

which is just half the old value. With J of length 0, we can now apply Theorem

our theorem. 0
If we want the map -< tll al >- ~ f to be differentiable, it is sufficient, by
Theorem 9.4 of Chapter 4, to know in addition to the above that
K:(JXN)X'U~V

is continuously differentiable. And to deduce this, it is sufficient to suppose that
dF exists and is utniformly continuous on L X U.

-< to, ao>- in the Banach

DIFFERENTIABLE DEPENDENCE ON PARAMETEUS

the context of the above theorem, the solution f is a continuously differentiable function of the initial value -< tt, at >- .
Proof. We have to show that the map K(tt, at, f) from (J X N) X '11 to Vis continuously differentiable, after which we can apply Theorem 9.4 of Chapter 4, as
we remarked above. Now the mapping h 1--+ k defined by k(t) = ft~ h(s) ds is a
bounded linear mapping from V to V which clearly depends continuously on tt,
and by Theorem 14.3 of Chapter 3 the integrand map f 1--+ h defined by h(s) =
F(s, f(s)) is continuously differentiable on '11. Composing these two maps we see
that dK~tl''''l.J> exists and is continuous on J X N X '11. Now

LlK~tl''''l.J>(~)

= ~,

so that dK 2 = I, and LlK~tl''''l.J>(h) = - ft~l+h F(s,f(s)) ds, from which it
follows easily that dK~tl''''l.J>(h) =-hF(tt,f(t)). The three partial differentials
dK t , dK 2 , and dK 3 thus exist and are continuous on J X N X '11, and it follows
from Theorem 8.3 of Chapter 3 that KCtt, at, f) is continuously differentiable
there. D
Corollary. If s is any point in J, then the value f(s) of a solution at s is a
differentiable function of its value at to.

Proof. Let f", be the solution through -< to, a>-. By the theorem, a 1--+ f", is a
continuously differentiable map from N to the function space V = ffie(J, W).
Eut 71'8: f 1--+ f(s) is a bounded linear mapping and thus trivially continuously
differentiable. Composing these two maps, we see that a 1--+ f",(s) is continuously
differentiable on N. D
It is also possible to make the continuous and differentiable dependence of
the solution on its initial value -< to, ao>- into a global affair. The following is
the theorem. We shall not go into its proof here.
Theorem 2.3. Let f be the maximal solution through -< to, ao>- with domain
J, and let [a, b] be any finite closed subinterval of J containing to. Then there
exists an E > 0 such that for every -< tt, at >- E B E( -< to, ao>-) the domain
of the global solution through -<tt, at >- includes [a, b], and the restriction
of this solution to [a, b] is a continuous function of -< tt, at >-. If F satisfies
the hypotheses of Theorem 2.2, then this dependence is continuously
differentiable.

Finally, suppose that F depends continuously (or continuously differentiably) on a parameter A, so that we have F(A, t, a) on M X I X A. Now the
solution f to the initial-value problem
f'(t) = F(t,f(t)),

depends on the parameter A as well as on the initial condition fUt) = at, and if
the reader has fully understood our arguments above, he will see that we can
show in the same way that the dependence of f on A is also continuous (continuously differentiable). We shall not go into these details here.

3. THE LINEAR EQUATION

We now suppose that the function F of Section 1 is from I X W to Wand continuous, and that F(t, a) is linear in a for each fixed t. It is not hard to see that
we then automatically have the strong Lipschitz hypothesis of Theorem 1.4,
which we shall in any case now assume. Here this is a boundedness condition
on a linear map: we are assuming that F(t, a) = Tt(a), where T t E Hom W,
and that II Ttll :::; e(t) for all t, where e(t) is continuous on I.
As one might expect, in this situation the existence and uniqueness theory of
Section 1 makes contact with general linear theory. Let X 0 be the vector space
e(1, W) of all continuous functions from I to W, and let X 1 be its subspace
e 1 (1, W) of all functions having continuous first derivatives. Norms will play
no role in our theorem.
Theorem 3.1. The mapping S: X 1 ~ X 0 defined by setting g = Sf if
get) = f'(t) - F(t, f(t)) is a surjective linear mapping. The set N of global
solutions of the differential equation da/dt = F(t, a) is the null space of S,
and is therefore, in particular, a vector space. For each to E I the restriction
to N of the coordinate (evaluation) mapping 'Trto: f ~ f(t o) is an isomorphism
from N to W. The null space M of 'Trto is therefore a complement of N in X 1,
and so determines a right inverse R of S. The mapping f ~ -< Sf, f(to) >
is an isomorphism from X 1 to X 0 X W, and this fact is equivalent to all
the above assertions.

Proof. For any fixed gin Xo we set G(t, a) = F(t, a)
get) and consider the
(nonlinear) equation da/dt = G(t, a). By Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 it has a unique
maximal solution f through any initial point -< to, ao>, and the domain of f is
the whole of I. That is, for each pair -< g, a> in X 0 X W there is a unique f in
X 1 such that -< Sf, f(to) > = -< g, a>. The mapping
-<S, 'Trto> :f~ -<Sf,f(t o»

is thus bijective, and since it is clearly linear, it is an isomorphism. In particular,
S is surjective. The null space N of S is the inverse image of {O} X W under the
above isomorphism; that is, 'Trto r N is an isomorphism from N to W.
Finally, the null space M of 'Trto is the inverse image of X 0 X {O} under
-< S, 'Tr to> , and the direct sum decomposition X 1 = M $ N simply reflects the
decomposition X 0 X W = (X 0 X {O}) EB ({O} X W) under the inverse isomorphism. This finishes the proof of the theorem. 0
The problem of finding, for a given g in X 0 and a given ao in W, the unique f
in X 1 such that S(f) = g and f(t o) = ao is called the initial-value problem. At
the theoretical level, the problem is solved by the above theorem, which states
that the uniquely determined f exists. At the practical level of computation, the
problem remains important.
The fact that M = Mt o is a complement of N breaks down the initial-value
problem into two independent subproblems. The right inverse R associated with

Mt o finds h in X 1 such that S(h) = g and h(t o) = O. The inverse of the isomorphism f 1-+ f(to) from N to W selects that k in Xl such that S(k) = 0 and
k(t o) = ao. Then f = h + k. The first subproblem is the problem of "solving
the inhomogeneous equation with homogeneous initial data ", and the second is
the problem of "solving the homogeneous equation with inhomogeneous initial
data". In a certain sense the initial-value problem is the "direct sum" of these
two independent problems.
We shall now study the homogeneous equation da/dt = Tt(a) more closely.
As we saw above, its solution space N is isomorphic to W under each projection
map 'lrt = f 1-+ f(t). Let CPt be this isomorphism (so that CPt = 'lrt N). We now
choose some fixed to in I-we may as well suppose that I contains 0 and take
to = O-and set K t = CPt 0 CPOI. Then {K t} is a one-parameter family of linear
isomorphisms of W with itself, and if we setf(3(t) = K t ({3), thenf(3 is the solution
of da/dt = Tt(a) passing through <0, fJ>. We call K t a fundamental solution of
the homogeneous equation da/dt = Tt(a).
Since fp(t) = Tt(f(3(t)), we see that d(Kt)/dt = T t 0 K t in the sense that
the equation is true at each fJ in W. However, the derivative d(Kt)/dt does not
necessarily exist as a norm limit in Hom W. This is because our hypotheses on T,
do not imply that the mapping t 1-+ T t is continuous from I to Hom W. If this
mapping is continuous, then the mapping <t, A> 1-+ T t 0 A is continuous from
I X Hom W to Hom W, and the initial-value problem

r

dA/dt = T t 0 A,

Ao = I

has a unique solution At in (31(1, Hom W). Because evaluation at fJ is a bounded
linear mapping from Hom W to W, At(fJ) is a differentiable function of t and

This implies that At(fJ) = Kt(fJ) for all fJ, so K t = At. In particular, the
fundamental solution t 1-+ K t is now a differentiable map into Hom W, and
dKt/dt = T t 0 K t. We have proved the following theorem.
Theorem. 3.2. Let t

1-+ T t be a continuous map from an interval neighborhood I of 0 to Hom W. Then the fundamental solution t 1-+ K t of the
differential equation da/dt = Tt(a) is the parametrized arc from I to
Hom W that is the solution of the initial-value problem dA/dt = T t 0 A,
Ao = I.

In terms of the isomorphisms K t = K(t), we can now obtain an explicit
solution for the inhomogeneous equation dajdt = Tt(a) + g(t). We want f such
that
f'(t) - Tt(f(t)) = g(t).
Now K'(t) = T t 0 K(t), so that T t = K'(t) 0 K(t)-l, and it follows from
Exercise 8.12 of Chapter 4 and the general product rule for differentiation

(Theorem 8.4 of Chapter 3) that the left side of the equation above is exactly

K(t)

(~t [K(t)-l (J(t) )]) .

The equation we have to solve can thus be rewritten as

We therefore have an obvious solution, and even if the reader has found our
:plOtivating argument too technical, he should be able to check the solution by
differentiating.

This therefore is a formula for the right inverse R of S determined by thp
complement M 0 of the null space N of S.
The special case of the constant coefficient equation, where the "coefficient"
operator T t is a fixed T in Hom W, is extremely important. The first new fact.
to be observed is that if f is a solution of da/dt = T(a), then so is 1'. For the
equationf'(t) = T(j(t) has a differentiable right-hand side, and differentiating,
we getf"(t) = T(j'(t). That is:
Lelllllla 3.1.

da/dt

The solution space N of the constant coefficient equation

= T(a) is invariant under the derivative operator D.

Moreover, we see from the differential equation that the operator D on N
is just composition with T. More precisely, the equation f'(t) = T(J(t) can be
rewritten 'lrt 0 D = To 'lrt, and since the restriction of 'lrt to N is the isomorphism CPt from N to W, this equation can be solved for T. We thus have the
following lemma.
Lemma 3.2. For each fixed t the isomorphism CPt from N to W takes the
derivative operator D on N to the operator T on W. That is,

THE LINEAR EQUATION

If T satisfies a polynomial equation p(T) = 0, as we know it must if W is
finite-dimensional, then our analysis can be carried significantly further. Suppose
for now that p has only real roots, so that its relatively prime factorization is
p(x) = II~(x - Xi)m i. Then we know from Theorem 5.5 of Chapter 1 that W
is the direct sum W = EB~ Wi of the null spaces Wi of the transformations
(T - Xi)m i , and that each Wi is invariant under T. This gives us a much simpler
form for the solution curve etTa if the point a is in one of the null spaces Wi.
Taking such a subspace Wi itself as W for the moment, we have (T - Xl)m = 0,
so that T = XI
R, where Rm = 0, and the factorization etT = et).e tR ,
together with the now finite series expansion of etR , gives us

In the general situation where W = EB~ Wi, we have a = L:~ ai, etT(a), =

through the general point -< 0, a>- is thus a finite sum of terms of the form

If W is a complex Banach space, then the restriction that p have only real
roots is superfluous. We get exactly the same formula but with complex values
of X. This introduces more variety into the behavior of the solution curves
since an outside exponential factor et). = etpe iIP now has a periodic factor if

Altogether we have proved the following theorem.

It is important to notice how the asymptotic behavior of f(t) as t ---?

controlled by the polynomial roots Ai. We first restrict ourselves to the solution

4. THE nTH-ORDER LINEAR EQUATION

The nth-order linear differential equation is the equation

dna/dtn

where GCt, a) = GCt, ab ..• , an) is now linear from V = wn to W for each t in I.
We convert this to a first-order equation da/dt = FCt, a) just as before, where
now F is a map from I X V to V that is linear in its second variable a, FCt, a) =
TtCa).
Our proof of Theorem 1.5 showed that a functionf in e(n) (I, W) is a solution
of the nth-order equation dna/dtn = G(t, a, ... , dn-Ia/dt n- l ) if and only if
the n-tuplet 1/;f = -<f,!', ... ,f(n-O> is a solution of the first-order equation
da/dt = F(t, a) = TtCa). We know that the latter solutions form a vector
subspace N of el(I, wn), and since the map 1/;: f I--'t -<f,!', ... ,!'n-l) > is
linear from en(l, W) to el(I, W n), it follows that the set N of solutions of the
nth-order equation is a subspace of en(I, W) and 1/; N is an isomorphism from
'N to N. Since the coordinate evaluation CPt = 7rt N is an isomorphism from N
to wn for each t (Theorem 3.1), it follows that the map

f(n-OCt) = O.
We now consider the special case W = ~. For each fixed t, G is now a linear
map from ~n to ~, that is, an element of c~n)*, and its coordinate set with
respect to the standard basis is an n-tuple k = -< kl' ... , k n > . Since the
linear map varies continuously with t, the n-tuple k varies continuously with t.

Giving n ) a coefficient function an changes nothing provided an(t) is never
zero, since then it can be divided out to give the form we have studied. This is
called the regular case. The singular case, where an(t) is zero for some t, requires
further study, and we shall not go into it here.
We recapitulate what our general linear theory tells us about this situation.
Theorem 4.1. L is a surjective linear transformation from the space en(l)

of all real-valued functions on I having continuous derivatives through
order n to the space e°(I) = e(I) of continuous functions on I. Its null
space N is the solution space of our original differential equation. For
each to in I the restriction to N of the mapping <Pto 0 1/;:fl---7 -<f(t o), ... ,
tn-°(tO) >- is an isomorphism from N to !R. n, and the set Mt o of functions
f in en such that f(to) = ... = fIn-OCto) = 0 is therefore a complement
of N in en(I), and determines a linear right inverse of L.
The practical problem of "solving" the differential equation LU) = g for J
when g is given falls into two parts. First we have to find the null space N of L,
that is, we have to solve the homogeneous equation LU) = O. Since N is all
n-dimensional vector space, the problem of delineating it is equivalent to finding
a basis, and this is clearly the efficient way to proceed. Our first problem therefore is to find n linearly independent solutions {uiE of LU) = O. Our second
problem is to find a right inverse of L, that is, a linear way of picking one f such
that LU) = g for each g. Here the obvious thing to do is to try to make th(,
formula of Theorem 3.3 into a practical computation. If v is one solution or
LU) = g, then of course the set of all solutions is the affine subspace N
v.
We shall start with the first problem, that of finding a basis {Ui} ~ of solutiolls
to LU) = O. Unfortunately, there is no general method available, and we hav(~
to be content with partial success. We shall see that we can easily solve thp
first-order equation directly, and that if we can find one solution of the nthorder equation, then we can reduce the problem to solving an equation of order
n - 1. Moreover, in the very important special case of an operator L with
constant coefficients, Theorem 3.4 gives a complete explicit solution.
The first-order homogeneous linear equation can be written in the form
y'
a(t)y = 0, where the coefficient of y' has been divided out. Dividing by y

+

+

6.4

THE nTH-ORDER LINEAR EQUATION

283

and remembering that y' /y = (log y)" we see that, formally at least, a solution
is given by log y = - Ja(t) dt or y = e-fa<tldt, and we can check it by inspection. Thus the equation y'
y/t = 0 has a solution y = e-1og t = 1ft, as the
reader might have noticed directly.
Suppose now that L is an nth-order operator and that we know one solution
U of Lf = o. Our problem then is to find n - 1 solutions VlJ ••• ,Vn-l independent of each other and of u. It might even be reasonable to guess that these
could be determined as solutions of an equation of order n - 1. We try to find
a second solution vet) in the form c(t)u(t), where c(t) is an unknown function.
Our motivation, in part, is that such a solution would automatically be independent of u unless c(t) turns out to be a constant.
Now if vet) = c(t)u(t), then v' = cu'
c'u, and generally

where S is a certain linear differential operator of order n - 1 which can be
explicitly computed from the above formulas. We claim that solving S(n = 0
solves our original problem. For suppose that {gin- l is a basis for the null
space of S, and set Ci(t) = Jci gi. Then L(CiU) = S(c~) = S(gi) = 0 for i =
1, ... , n - 1. Moreover, u, ClU, ... ,Cn_lU are independent, for if u =
L~-l kic.u, then 1 = L~-l kiCi(t) and 0 = L~-l kiC~(t) = L~-l kigi(t), contradicting the independence of the set {gi}.
We have thus shown that if we can find one solution u of the nth-order
equation Lf = 0, then its complete solution is reduced to solving an equation
Sf = 0 of order n - 1 (although our independence argument was a little
sketchy).
This reduction procedure does not combine with the solution of the firstorder equation to build up a sequence of independent solutions of the nth-order
equation because, roughly speaking, it "works off the top instead of off the
bottom". For the combination to be successful, we would have to be able to
find from a given nth-order operator a first-order operator S such that N(S) C
N(L), and we can't do this in general. However, we can do it when the coefficient
functions in L are all constants, although we shall in fact proceed differently.
Meanwhile it is valuable to note that a second-order equation Lf = 0 can
be solved completely if we can find one solution u, since the above argument
reduces the remaining problem to a first-order equation which can then be solved
by an integration, as we saw earlier. Consider, for instance, the equation
y" - 2y/t 2 = 0 over any interval I not containing 0, so that ao(t) = l/t 2 is
continuous on I. We see by inspection that u(t) = t 2 is one solution. Then we

284

G.·\

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

know that we can find a solution vet) independent of u(t) in the form vet) = t 2c(t)
and that the problem will become a first-order problem for c'. We have, in fac1,
v' = t 2 c' + 2tc and v" = t 2 c" + 4tc' + 2c, so that L(v) = v" - 2v/t 2 =
t 2 c" 4tc', and L(v) = 0 if and only if (c')'

(The reader may wish to check that this is the promised solution.) The null
space of the operator LU) = f" - 2f/t 2 is thus the linear span of {t 2 , l/t] .
We now turn to an important tractable case, the differential operator

Lf = anf(n)

+ an_d(n-O + ... + aof,

where the coefficients ai are constants and an might as well be taken to 1. What
makes this case accessible is that now L is a polynomial in the derivative operator
D. That is, if Df =!" so that Djf = f(j), then L = p(D), where p(x) =
L~ aixi.
The most elegant, but not the most elementary, way to handle this equation
is to go over to the equivalent first-order system dx/dt = T(x) on IR n and to
apply the relevant theory from the last section.
Theorem 4.2. If pet) = (t - b)n, then the solution space N of the
stant coefficient nth-order equation p(D)f = 0 has the basis

COIl-

{e bt , te bt , ... , tn-1e bt }.
If pet) is a polynomial which has a relatively prime factorization pet) =
II~ Pi(t) with each P.(t) of the above fonn, then the solution space of the
constant coefficient equation p(D)f = 0 has the basis UB" where Bi is th(!
above basis for the solution space Ni of pi(D)f = O.

Proof. We know that the mapping if;:f~ <'f,!', ... ,f(n-O>- is an isomorphism from the null space N of p(D) to the null space N of dx/dt - T(x). It i;;
clear that if; commutes with differentiation, if;(Df) = <.!', ... , f(n) >- = Dif; (f) ,
and since we know that N is invariant under D by Lemma 3.1, it follows (and call
easily be checked directly) that N is invariant under D. By Lemma 3.2 we have
T = CPt 0 D 0 CPt 1, which simply says that the isomorphism CPt: N ---7 IR n take;;
the operator D on N into the operator T on IRn. Altogether CPt 0 if; takes D
on N into Ton IR n, and since p(D) = 0 on N, it follows that peT) = 0 on IRn.
We saw in Theorem 3.4 that if peT) = 0 and p = (t - b)n, then the
solution space N of dx/dt = T(x) is spanned by vectors of the form

The first coordinates of the n-tuple-valued functions g in N form the space N
(under the isomorphism f = if;-lg), and we therefore see that N is spanned by
the functions ebt , ... ,tn-1ebt . Since N is n-dimensional, and since there are n
of these functions, the spanning set forms a basis.

The remainder of the theorem can be viewed as the combination of the
above and the direct application of Theorem 5.5 of Chapter 1 to the equation
p(D) = 0 on N, or as the carry-over to N under the isomorphism 1/; -1 of the facts
already established for N in the last section. 0
If the roots of the polynomial p are not all real, then we have to resort to
the complexification theory that we developed in the exercises of Section 11,
Chapter 4. Except for one final step, the results are the same. The one extra
fact that has to be applied is that the null space of a real operator T acting on a
real vector space Y is exactly the intersection with Y of the null space of the
complexification S of T acting on the complexification Z = Y EB iY of Y.
This implies that if p(t) is a polynomial with real coefficients, then we get the
real solutions of p(D)f = 0 as the real parts of the complex solutions. In order
to see exactly what this means, suppose that q(x) = (x 2 - 2bx
c)m is one of
the relatively prime factors of p(x) over tR, with x 2 - 2bx c irreducible over tR.
Over C, q(x) factors into (x - A)m(X - x)m, where A = b + iw and w 2 = c - b 2.
It follows from our general theory above that the complex 2m-dimensional
null space of q(D) is the complex span of

+

+

e~t teXt
{e ht, teht , ... , t m- 1eht"
, ... , t m- 1eXt } .

The real parts of the complex linear combinations of these 2m functions is a
2m-dimensional real vector space spanned by the real parts of the above functions
and the real parts of i times the above functions. That is, the null space of the
real operator q(D) is a 2m-dimensional real space spanned by
{e bt cos wt, te bt cos wt, ... , t m- 1ebt cos wt; ebt sin wt, ... , t m- 1ebt sin wt}.

Since there are 2m of these functions, they must be independent and must form
a basis for the real solution space of q(D)f = O. Thus,
Theorelll 4.3. If p(t) = (t2 + 2bt + c)m and b 2 < c, then the solution space
of the constant coefficient 2mth-order equation p(D)f = 0 has the basis
{ t i ebt

{ i bt·
}m-l
cos wt }m-l
i=O ute sm wt i=O,

where w2 = c - b2. For any polynomial p(t) with real coefficients, if p(t) =
II~ Pi(t) is its relatively prime factorization into powers of linear factors and
powers of irreducible quadratic factors, then the solution space N of
p(D)f = 0 has the basis U~ B i , where Bi is the basis for the null space of
Pi(D) that we displayed above if Pi(t) is a power of an irreducible quadratic,
and Bi is the basis of Theorem 4.2 if Pi(t) is a power of a linear factor.
Suppose, for example, that we want to find a basis for the null space of
D4 - 1 = O. Here p(x) = X4 - 1 = (x - l)(x + l)(x - i)(x + i). The
basis for the complex solution space is therefore {e t, e- t, eit, e-it }. Since eit =
cos t i sin t, the basis for the real solution space is {e t, e-t, cos t, sin t}.

so that the basis for the complex solution space is

and the basis for the real solution space is
{e t , e- t/ 2 cos (V3t/2), e- t/ 2 sin (y'3t/2)}.

* Our results above suggest that the collection a of all real-valued
solutions of constant coefficient homogeneous linear differential equations contains the functions ti, ert , cos wt, sin wt for all i, r, and w, and is closed under
addition and multiplication, and is in fact the algebra generated by these functions.
We can easily prove this conjecture. We first consider sums. Suppose that
T(f) = 0 and that S(g) = 0, where Sand T are two such constant coefficient
operators. Then f
g is in the null space of SoT because Sand T commute:
(S 0 T)(f + g) = (S 0 T)(f) + (S 0 T)(g) = S(Tf) + T(Sg) = 0 + 0 = o. We
know that Sand T commute because they are both polynomials in D.
In order to treat products, we first have to recognize that the linear span of
all the trigonometric functions sin at, cos bt is an algebra. In other words, any
finite product of such functions is a linear combination of such functions. This
is the role of a certain class of trigonometric identities, such as 2 sin x cos y =
sin (x
y)
sin (x - y), which the reader has undoubtedly had to struggle
with. (And again the mystery disappears when we are allowed to treat them
as complex exponentials.) Then we observe that any function in the algebra a is
a finite sum of terms each of which is of the form tV t sin wt or tV t cos wt for
some i, r, and w. We can exhibit an operator T having such a function in its
null space, and our finite sum of such terms will then be in the null space of the
composition of these operators T by our first argument.
We are tempted to say one more thing. The functions ti, ert , sin wt, cos wt,
and sums of their products can be shown to be exactly the continuous functions
f: IR - IR such that the set of translates of f has a finite-dimensional span. That
is, if we define translation through x, K x, by (Kxf)(t) = f(t - x), then for
exactly the above functionsfthe linear span of {Kxf, x E IR} is finite-dimensional.
This second characterization of exactly the same class of functions cannot be
accidental. Part of the secret lies in the fact that the constant coefficient operators T are exactly those linear differential operators that commute with translation. That is, if T is a linear differential operator, then T 0 Kx = Kx 0 T for
all x if and only if T has constant coefficients. Now we have noted in an early
chapter that if To S = SoT, then the null space of T is invariant under S.
Therefore, the null space N of a constant coefficient operator T is invariant under
all translations: Kx[N] eN for all x. Now we know that N is finite-dimensional

+

6.4

THE n!l'H-ORDER LINEAR EQUATION

from our differential equation theory. Therefore, the functions in N are such
that their translates have a finite-dimensional span!
This device of gaining additional information about the null space N of a
linear operator T by finding operators S that commute with T, so that N is
S-invariant, is much used in advanced mathematics. It is especially important
when we have a group of commuting operators S, as we do in the above case with
the operators S = K",.
What we have not shown is that if a continuous function f is such that its
translation generates a finite-dimensional vector space, then f is in the null space
of some constant coefficient operator p(D). This is delicate, and it depends on
showing that if {K t } is a one-parameter family of linear transformations on a
finite-dimensional space such that K.+ t = K. 0 K t and K t --7 I as t --7 0, then
there is an S in Hom V such that K t = ets .*

5. SOLVING THE INHOMOGENEOUS EQUATION

We come now to the problem of solving the inhomogeneous equation L(f) = g.
We shall briefly describe a practical method which works easily some of the time
and a theoretical method which works all the time, but which may be hard to
apply. The latter is just the translation of Theorem 3.3 into matrix language.
We first consider the constant coefficient equation L(f) = g in the special
case where g itself is in the null space of a constant coefficient operator S. A
simple example is y' - ay = ebt (or y' - ay = sin bt), where g(t) = ebt is in the
null space of S = (D - b). In such a situation a solution f must be in the
null space of SoL, for So L(f) = S(g) = O. We know what all these functions
are, and our problem is to select f among them such that L(f) is the given g.
For the moment suppose that the polynomials Land S (polynomials in D)
have no factors in common. Then we know that L is an isomorphism on the
null space N s of S and therefore that there exists an f in N s such that Lf = g.
Since we have a basis for N s, we could construct the matrix for the action of Lon
N s and find f by solving a matrix equation, but the simplest thing to do is take
a general linear combination of the basis, with unknown coefficients, let L act
on it, and see what the coefficients must be to give g.
For example, to solve y' - ay = ebt , we try f(t) = cebt and apply
L: (D - a)(ce bt )

(b - a)ce bt J, ebt ,

=

and we see that c = 1j(b - a).
Again, to solve y' - ay = cos bt, we observe that cos bt is in the null space
of S = D2
b 2 and that this null space has the basis {sin bt, cos bt}. We
therefore set f(t) = CI sin bt C2 cos bt and solve (D - a)f = cos bt, getting

+

+

(-acI - bC2) sin bt

+ (bCI

- aC2) cos bt

=

cos bt,

-aCI - bC2 = 0,
bCI - aC2 = 1,
and
f(t) =

2

a

b b2 sin bt -

+

2

a

a b2 cos bt.

+

When Land S do have factors in common, the situation is more complicated,
but a similar procedure can be proved to work. Now an extra factor ti must be
introduced, where i is the number of occurrences of the common factor in L.
For example, in solving (D - r)2f = eTt, we have SoL = (D - r)3, and so
we must set f(t) = ct 2eTt . Our equation then becomes
(D - r)2ct 2 eTt

=

2ce Tt J, eTt,

and so C = !.
For (D 2 + 1)f = sin t we have to set f(t)
we work it out we find that CI = 0 and C2 =

= t(CI sin t + C2 cos t), and after
so that f = -!t cos t.

This procedure, called, naturally, the method of undetermined coefficients, violates our philosophy about a solution process being a linear right inverse. Indeed,
it is not a single process, applicable to any g occurring on the right, but varies
with the operator S. However, when it is available, it is the easiest way to compute explicit solutions.
We describe next a general theoretical method, called variation of parameters,
that is a right inverse to L and does therefore apply to every g. Moreover, it
inverts the general (variable coefficient) linear nth-order operator L:
(Lf)(t) =

L:" ai(t)j<i)(t).

o
We are assuming that we know the null space N of Lj that is, we assume
known n linearly independent solutions {Ui}~ of the homogeneous equation
Lf = O. What we are going to do is to translate into this context our formula
K t f~ K-;l(g(S») ds for the solution to da/dt = Tt(a)
get). Since

to the solution space N of the equivalent first-order system dx/dt = Tt(x), it
follows that if we have a basis {uiH for N, then the columns of the matrix
Wij = uji-ll form a basis for N.
Let wet) be the matrix Wij(t) = uji-o (t). Since evaluation at t is the isomorphism tpt from N to IR", the columns of wet) form a basis for IR", for each t.
But Kt(a) is the value at t of the solution of dx/dt = TI(x) through the initial
point -< 0, a> , and it follows that the linear transformation KI takes the columns
of the matrix w(O) to the corresponding columns of wet). The matrix for KI is
therefore wet) . w(O)-l, and the matrix form of our formula
f(t) = Ktlot (Ks)-l(g(S») ds

is therefore
f(t) = wet) . w(O)-l . lot w(O) . w(S)-l . g(s) ds.

Moreover, since integration commutes with the application of a constant linear
transformation (here multiplication by a constant matrix), the middle w(O)
factors cancel, and we have the result that

N ow we want to solve the inhomogeneous nth-order equation L(f) = g, and
this means solving the first-order system with g = -< 0, ... , 0, g>-. Therefore,

the following theorem.

This is all we shall say about the process of finding solutions. In cases where
everything works we have complete control of the solutions of L(f) = g, and
we can then solve the initial-value problem. If L has order n, then we know that
the null space N is n-dimensional, and if for a given g the function v is one
solution of the inhomogeneous equation L(f) = g, then the set of all solutions is
the n-dimensional plane (affine subspace) M = N
v. If we have found a
basis {Ui} ~ for N, then every solution of L(f) = g is of the form I = L~ CiUi v.
The initial-value problem is the problem of finding I such that L(f) = g and
l(to) = aY,,!,(t o) = ag, . .. ,!'n-l)(to) = a~, where <.aY, ... , a~>- = a O is the
given initial value. We can now find this unique I by using these n conditions
to determine the n coefficients Ci in I = L CiUi V. We get n equations in the n
unknowns Ci. Our ability to solve this problem uniquely again comes back to the
fact that the matrix Wij(t O) = uji-ll(tO) is nonsingular, as did our success in
carrying out the variation of parameters process.
We conclude this section by discussing a very simple and important example.
When a perfectly elastic spring is stretched or compressed, it resists with a
"restoring" force proportional to its deformation. If we picture a coiled spring
lying along the x-axis, with one end fixed and the free end at the origin when
undisturbed (Fig. 6.3), then when the coil is stretched a distance x (compression
being negative stretching), the force it exerts is -cx, where C is a constant representing the stiffness, or elasticity, of the spring, and the minus sign shows
that the force is in the direction opposite to the displacement. This is Hooke's

+

+

+

law.

Fig. 6.3

Suppose that we attach a point mass m to the free end of the spring, pull the
spring out to an initial position xo = a, and let go. The reader knows perfectly
well that the system will then oscillate, and we want to describe its vibration
explicitly. We disregard the InaSS of the spring itself (which amounts to adjusting m), and for the moment we suppose that friction is zero, so that the
system will oscillate forever. Newton's law says that if the force F is applied to
the mass m, then the particle will accelerate according to the equation
d2 x
m dt 2

= F.

Here F = -cx, so the equation combining the laws of Newton and Hooke is

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

This is almost the simplest constant coefficient equation, and we know that the
general solution is
x = CI sin Qt
C2 cos Qt,

+

where Q = v'c/m. Our initial condition was that x = a and x' = 0 when t = O.
Thus C2 = a and CI = 0, so x = a cos Qt. The particle oscillates forever
between x = -a and x = a. The maximum displacement a is called the
amplitude A of the oscillation. The number of complete oscillations per unit time
is called the frequency f, so f = Q/27r = v'C/27rVm. This is the quantitative
expression of the intuitively clear fact that the frequency will increase with the
stiffness c and decrease as the mass m increases. Other initial conditions are
equally reasonable. We might consider the system originally at rest and strike
it, so that we start with an initial velocity v and an initial displacement 0 at
time t = O. Now C2 = 0 and x = CI sin Qt. In order to evaluate Cll we remember that dx/dt = v at t = 0, and since dx/dt = CIQ cos Qt, we have v = CIQ
and CI = v/Q, the amplitude for this motion. In general, the initial condition
would be x = a and x' = v when t = 0, and the unique solution thus determined
would involve both terms of the general solution, with amplitude to be calculated.
The situation is both more realistic and more interesting when friction is
taken into account. Frictional resistance is ideally a force proportional to the
velocity dx/ dt but again with a negative sign, since its direction is opposite to
that of the motion. Our new equation is thus
d2x
m dt 2

+ k dx
dt + cx =

0,

and we know that the system will act in quite different ways depending on the
relationship among the constants m, k, and c. The reader will be asked to explore
these equations further in the exercises.
It is extraordinary that exactly the same equation governs a freely oscillating
electric circuit. It is now written
d2x

dx

L dt 2+ R dt

where L, R, and C are the inductance, resistance, and capacitance of the circuit,
respectively, and dx/dt is the current. However, the ordinary operation of such
a circuit involves forced rather than free oscillation. An alternating (sinusoidal)
voltage is applied as an extra, external, "force" term, and the equation is now

This shows the most interesting behavior of alL Using the method of undetermined coefficients, we find that the solution contains transient terms that
die away, contributed by the homogeneous equation, and a permanent part of
frequency w/27r, arising from the inhomogeneous term a sin wt. New phenomena
called phase and resonance now appear, as the reader will discover in the exercises.

6. THE BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEM

We now turn to a problem which seems to be like the initial-value problem but
which turns out to be of a wholly different character. Suppose that T is a secondorder operator, which we consider over a closed interval [a, b]. Some of the most
important problems in physics require us to find solutions to T(f) = g such that
f has given values at a and b, instead of f and l' having given values at a single
point to. This new problem is called a boundary-value problem, because {a, b} is
the boundary of the domain I = [a, b]. The boundary-value problem, like the
initial-value problem, breaks neatly into two subproblems if the set
M = {j E

e 2 ([a,

b]) : f(a) = f(b) = O}

turns out to be a complement of the null space N of T. However, if the reader
will consider this general question for a moment, he will realize that he doesn't
have a clue to it from our initial-value development, and, in fact, wholly new
tools have to be devised.
Our procedure will be to forget that we are trying to solve the boundaryvalue problem and instead to speculate on the nature of a linear differential

6.6

THE BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEM

operator T from the point of view of scalar products and the theory of selfadjoint operators. That is, our present study of T will be by means of the scalar
product (f, g) =
f(t)g(t) dt, the general problem being the usual one of
solving Tf = g by finding a right inverse S of T. Also, as usual, S may be determined by finding a complement M of N(T). Now, however, it turns out that if T
is "formally self-adjoint", then suitable choices of M will make the associated
right inverses S self-adjoint and compact, and the eigenvectors of S, computed as
those solutions of the homogeneous equation Tf - rf = 0 which lie in M, then
allow (relatively) the same easy handling of S, by virtue of Theorem 5.1 of
Chapter 5, that they gave us earlier in the finite-dimensional situation.
We first consider the notion of "formal adjoint" for an nth-order linear
differential operator T. The ordinary formula for integration by parts,

J:

allows the derivatives of f occurring in the scalar product (Tf, g) to be shifted
one at a time to g. At the end, f is undifferentiated and g is acted on by a certain
nth-order linear differential operator R. The endpoint evaluations, like the
above fgl~, that accumulate step by step can be described as
B(f, g)l: =

L

kij(x)f(i)(x)g<il(x)l:,

O"':i+j<n

where the coefficient functions kij(x) are linear combinations of the coefficient
functions ai(x) and their derivatives. Thus
(Tf, g) = (f, Rg)

+ B(f, g)l~.

The operator R is called the formal adJ·oint of T, and if R
formally self-adjoint.

=

T, we say that T is

Every application of the integration by parts formula introduces a sign
change, and the reader may be able to see that the leading coefficient of R is
(-1) n times the leading coefficient of T. Assuming this, we see that a necessary
condition for formal self-adjointness is that n be even, so that Rand T have the
same first terms.
Supposing that T is formally self-adjoint, we seek a complement M of the
null space N of T in en([a, b]) with the further property that S, the associated
right inverse of T, is self-adjoint as a mapping from the pre-Hilbert space
eO([a, b]) to itself. Let us see what this further requirement amounts to. For
any u, v E eO, set f = Su and g = Sv, so that f and g are in M and u = Tf,
v = Tg.
Then (u, Sv) = (Tf, g) = (f, Tg) + B(f, g)l~ = (Su, v) + B(f, g)l~.
We thus have:

complement of the null space of T, then the right inverse of T determined

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Under any of conditions (1), (2), or (4), cd'jJ! = 0, and the two integral terms
are clearly bounded below by mllf'll~ and Ilfll~, respectively. Lemma 6.3 then
implies that !vI is a complement of the null space of T - "A. 0
We come now to our main theorem. It says that the right inverse S of T - "A
determined by the subspace !vI above is a compact self-adjoint mapping of the
pre-Hilbert space eO([a, b]) into itself, and is therefore endowed with all the rich
eigenvalue structures of Theorem 5.1 of the last chapter. First we present some
classical terminology. A Sturm-Liouville system on [a, b] is a formally self-adjoint
cof defined over the closed
second-order differential operator Tf = (cd')'
interval [a, b], together with a self-adjoint boundary ~ondition II (f) = l2(f) = 0
for that interval. If C2(t) is never zero on [a, b], the system is called regular. If
c2(a) or c2(b) is zero, or if the interval [a, b] is replaced by an infinite interval
such as [a, 00], then the system is called singular.

+

T: l1, l2 is a regular Sturm-Liouville system on [a, b], with
positive, then the subspace !vI defined by the homogeneous boundary
condition is a complement of N(T - "A) if "A is taken sufficiently large, and
the right inverse of T - "A thus determined by !vI is a compact self-adjoint
mapping of the pre-Hilbert space eO([a, b]) into itself.

Theorelll 6.1. If
C2

Proof. The proof depends on the inequality of the above lemma. Since we have
proved this inequality only for boundary conditions (1), (2), and.(4), our proof
will be complete only for those cases.
Set g = (T - "A)f. Since IIgl1211fl12 ~ I((T - "A)f,f)1 by the Schwarz
inequality, we see from the lemma first that Ilfll~ ::; Ilg11211f112' so that

::; IIgl1211fl12 ::; IIgll~, so that

and then that mllf'll~

11f'112 ::; IlgI12/vm.
We have already checked that the right inverse S of the formally selfadjoint T - "A defined by !vI is self-adjoint, and it remains for us to show that the
set S[U] = {f: IIgl12 ::; 1} has compact closure. For any such f the Schwarz
inequality and the above inequality imply that

Thus S[U] is uniformly equicontinuous. Since the common domain of the
functions in S[U] is the compact set [a, b], we will be able to conclude from
Theorem 6.1 of Chapter 4 that the set S[U] is totally bounded if we can show
that there is a constant C such that all the functions in S[U] have their ranges in
[-C, C]. Taking y and x in the last inequality where If I assumes its maximum
and minimum values, we have Ilfll", - min If I ::; (b - a) 1/2/vm.

Ilfll", ::;; e = l/(b - a)1/2 + (b - a)1/2/vm.

(min Ifl)(b - a)1/2 ::;;

Thus S[U] is a uniformly equicontinuous set of functions mapping the compact set [a, b] into the compact set [-e, e], and is therefore totally bounded in
the uniform norm. Since e([a, b]) is complete in the uniform norm, every sequence
in S[ U] has a subsequence uniformly converging to some fEe, and since
IIfll2 ::;; (b - a)1/21Ifll"" this subsequence also converges to f in the two-norm.
We have thus shown that if H is the pre-Hilbert space e([a, b]) under the
standard scalar product, then the image S[U] of the unit ball U C H under S has
the property that every sequence in S[U] has a subsequence converging in H.
This is the property we actually used in proving Theorem 5.1 of Chapter 5, but
it is not quite the definition of the compactness of S, which requires us to show
that the closure S[U] is compact in H. However, if {~n} is any sequence in this
closure, then we can choose {Sn} in S[U] so that II~n - snll < l/n. The sequence {s n} has a convergent subsequence {s n(m)} m as above, and then {~n(m)} m
converges to the same limit. Thus S is a compact operator. 0
There exists an orthonormal sequence {<Pn} consisting entirely
of eigenvectors of T and forming a basis for M. Moreover, the Fourier
expansion of any f E M with respect to the basis {<Pn} converges uniformly
to f (as well as in the two-norm).

Theorelll 6.2.

Proof. By Theorem 5.1 of Chapter 5 there exist an eigenbasis for the range of S,
which is M. Since S<Pn = 1'n<Pn for some nonzero rn, we have (T - X)(rn<Pn) =
<Pn and T<Pn = (1
Xrn)/rn)<Pn' The uniformity of the series convergence
comes out of the following general consideration.

+

Lelllllla 6.5. Suppose that T is a self-adjoint operator on a pre-Hilbert
space V and that T is compact as a mapping from V to -< V, q>- , where q is a
second norm on V that dominates the scalar product norm p (q 2:: cp).
Then T is compact (from p to p), and the eigenbasis expansion L bn<Pn of an
element {3 in the range of T converges to {3 in both norms.

Proof. Let U be the unit ball of V in the scalar product norm. By the hypothesis
of the lemma, the q-closure B of T[U] is compact. B is then also p-compact, for
any sequence in it has a q-convergent subsequence which also p-converges to the
same limit, because p ::;; cq. We can therefore apply the eigenbasis theorem.
Now let a and (3 = T(a) have the Fourier series L ai<Pi and L bi<Pi, and let
T(<Pi) = ri<Pi.
Then bi = riai, because bi = (T(a), <Pi) = (a, T(<Pi)) =
(a, ri<Pi) = ri(a, <Pi) = riai. Since the sequence of partial sums L~ ai<Pi is
p-bounded (Bessel's inequality), the sequence {L~ bi<Pi} = {T(L:~ ai<Pi)} is
totally q-bounded. Any subsequence of it therefore has a subsubsequence
q-converging to some element 'Y in V. Since it then p-converges to 'Y, 'Y must be {3.
Thus every subsequence has a subsubsequence q-converging to {3, and so
{L~ bi<Pi} itself q-converges to {3 by Lemma 4.1 of Chapter 4. 0

7. FOURIER SERIES

There are not many regular Sturm-Liouville systems whose associated orthonormal eigenbases have proved to be important in actual calculations. Most
orthonormal bases that are used, such as those due to Bessel, Legendre, Hermite,
and Laguerre, arise from singular Sturm-Liouville systems and are therefore
beyond the limitations we have set for this discussion. However, the most wellknown example, Fourier series, is available to us.
We shall consider the constant coefficient operator Tf = D2f, which is clearly
both formally self-adjoint and regular, and either the boundary condition
f(O) = f(7r) = 0 on [0, 7r] (type 1) or the periodic boundary conditionf( -7r) =
f(7r), f'(-7r) = f'(7r) on [-7r, 7r] (type 4).
To solve the first problem, we have to find the solutions of f" - V = 0
which satisfy f(O) = f(7r) = O. If}.. > 0, then we know that the two-dimensional solution space is spanned by {c rx , c- rx } , where r = }..1/2. But if CIC rx
C2C-rx is 0 at both 0 and 7r, then CI = C2 = 0 (because the pairs -< 1, 1>- and
-< cT1r , c- T1r >- are independent). Therefore, there are no solutions satisfying the
boundary conditions when}.. > O. If}.. = 0, then f(x) = CIX
Co and again
CI = Co = O.
If }.. < 0, then the solution space is spanned by {sin rx, cos rx}, where
r = (_}..) 1/2. Now if C1 sin rx
C2 cos rx is 0 at x = 0 and x = 7r, we get,
first, that C2 = 0 and, second, that r7r = n7r for some integer n. Thus the
eigenfunctions for the first system form the set {sin nx} f, and the corresponding
eigenvalues of D2 are {-n 2} f.
At the end of this section we shall prove that the functions in ~2([a, b])
that are zero near a and b are dense in ~([a, b]) in the two-norm. Assuming this,
it follows from Theorem 2.3 of Chapter 5 that a basis for M is a basis for ~o, and
we now have the following corollary of the Sturm-Liouville theorem.

+

+

+

TheoreD1 7.1. The sequence {sin nx}f is an orthogonal basis for the pre-

Hilbert space ~O([O, 7r]). If f E ~2([0, 7r]) and f(O) = f(7r) = 0, then the
Fourier series for f converges uniformly to f.
We now consider the second boundary problem. The computations are a
little more complicated, but again if f(x) = CIC rx
C2C-rx, and if f( -7r) = f(7r)
and 1'( -7r) = f'(7r), then f = O. For now we have

+

302

6.7

+

giving CI (eT'lr - e- r ll") = 0, and so CI = o. Again f(x) = CIX
Co is ruled out
Finally, if f(x) = CI sin rx
C2 cos rx, our boundary conditions become

+

and

2rC2 sin nr

so that again r = n, but this time the full solution space of (D2
satisfies the boundary condition.

+ n 2)f =

Theorem 7.2. The set {sin nx} ~ U {cos nx} 0 forms an orthogonal basis for
the pre-Hilbert space e O([ -7r, 7r]). If f E e 2 ([ -7r, 7r)) and f( -7r) = f(7r),
1'( -7r) = f'(7r), then the Fourier series for f converges to f uniformly on
[-7r,7r).
Remaining proof. This theorem follows from our general Sturm-Liouville discussion except for the orthogonality of sin nx and cos nx. We have
(sin nx, cos nx)

= f~lI" sin nt cos nt dt
= t f~" sin 2nt dt
= -(1/4n) cos 2nx)~1I"
= o.

Or we can simply remark that the first integrand is an odd function and therefore
its integral over any symmetric interval [-a, a) is necessarily zero.
The orthogonality of eigenvectors having different eigenvalues follows of
course, as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 of Chapter 5. 0
Finally, we prove the density theorem we needed above. There are very
slick ways of doing this, but they require more machinery than we have available, and rather than taking the time to make the machines, we shall prove the
theorem with our bare hands.
It is standard notation to let a subscript zero on a symbol denoting a class
of functions pick out those functions in the class that are zero "on the boundary"
in some suitable sense. Here eo([a, b)) will denote the functions in e([a, bJ) that
are zero in neighborhoods of a and b, and similarly for e~([a, b)).
Theorem 7.3. e 2 ([a, b)) is dense in e([a, b)) in the uniform norm, and
e6([a, b)) is dense in e([a, b)) in the two-norm.
Proof. We first approximate f E e([a, b)) to within E by a piecewise "linear"
function g by drawing straight line segments between the adjacent points on the
graph of f lying over a subdivision a = Xo < Xl < ... < Xn = b of [a, bJ.
If f varies by less than E on each interval (Xi-I, Xi), then Ilf - all"" :::; E. Now
a' (t) is a step function which is constant on the intervals of the above subdivision. We now alter g'(t) slightly near each jump in such a way that the new
function h(t) is continuous there. If we do it as sketched in Fig. 6.5, the total

integral error at the jump is zero, I:.0:,,& (h - g') = 0, and the maximum error
I:''-a is 611/4. This will be less than Eif we take 6 = E/llg'II"" since 11 ~ 21Ig'II",.
We now have a continuous function h such that II: h(t) dt - (J(x) - I(a)) I < 2E.
In other words, we have approximated I uniformly by a continuously differentiable function.
Now choose g and h in e1([a, b)) so that first III - gil", < E/2 and then
IIg' - hll", < E/2(b - a). Then
Ig(x) - g(O) -

10'" hi < E/2,

+

and so H(x) = fO' h g(O) is a twice continuously differentiable function such
that III - HII", < E. In other words, e 2«(a, b)) is dense in e([a, b]) in the
uniform norm. It is then also dense in the two-nonn, since

11/112 =

(ib12y/2 ~ 1I/1I",(i 1r/ 2 =
b

(b -

a)1/211/11",.

But now we can do something which we couldn't do for the uniform norm:
we can alter the approximating function to one that is zero on neighborhoods of a
and b, and keep the two-norm approximation good. Given 6, let e(t) be a nonnegative function on [a, b] such that e(t) = 1 on [a 26, b - 26], e(t) = 0 on
la, a
6] and on [b - 0, b], e" is continuous, and lIell", = 1. Such an e(t) clearly
exists, since we can draw it. We leave it as an interesting exercise to actually
define e(t). Here is a hint: Show somehow that there is a fifth-degree polynomial
pet} having a graph between 0 and 1 as shown in Fig. 6.6, with a zero second
derivative at 0 and at 1, and then use a piece of the graph, suitably translated,
compressed, rotated, etc., to help patch together e(t).
Anyway, then IIg - egl12 ~ IIgll",,(46)1/2 for any g on e([a, b)), and if g has
continuous derivatives up to order 2, then so does ego Thus, if we start with I in e
and approximate it by gin e 2 , and then approximate g by eg, we have altogether
the second approximation of the theorem. 0

MULTILINEAR FUNCTIONALS

This chapter is principally for reference. Although most of the proofs will be
included, the reader is not expected to study them. Our goal is a collection of
basic theorems about alternating multilinear functionals, or exterior forms, and
the determinant function is one of our rewards.
1. BILINEAR FUNCTIONALS

We have already studied various aspects of bilinear functionals. We looked at
their duality implications in Section 6, Chapter 1, we considered the "canonical
forms" of symmetric bilinear functionals and their equivalent quadratic forms
in Section 7, Chapter 2, and, of course, the whole scalar product theory of
Chapter 5 is the theory of a still more special kind of bilinear functional. In this
chapter we shall restrict ourselves to bilinear and multilinear functionals over
finite-dimensional spaces, and our concerns are purely algebraic.
We begin with some material related to our earlier algebra. If V and Ware
finite-dimensional vector spaces, then the set of all bilinear functionals on
V X W is pretty clearly a vector space. We designate it V* ® W* and call it
the tensor product of V* and W*. Our first theorem simply states something
that was implicit in Theorem 6.1 of Chapter 1.
TheoreIn 1.1. The vector spaces V* ® W*, Hom(V, W*), and Hom(W, V*)
are naturally isomorphic.

Proof. We saw in Theorem 6.1 of Chapter 1 that eachfin V* ® W* determines
a linear mapping a 1--+ fa from W to V*, wherefa(t) = f(t, a), and we also noted
that this correspondence from V* ® W* to Hom(W, V*) is bijective. All that
the present theorem adds is that this bijective correspondence is linear and so
constitutes a natural isomorphism, as does the similar one from V* ® W* to
Hom(V, W*). To see this, leth be the bilinear functional corresponding to Tin
Hom(V, W*). Then f(T+S) = h
fs, for f(T+S)(a, (3) = (T
S)(a))({3) =
(T(a)
S(a))({3) = (T(a))({3)
(S(a))({3) = h(a, (3)
fs(a, (3).
We can
do the same for homogeneity.
The isomorphism of V* ® W* with Hom(W, V*) follows in exactly the
same way by reversing the roles of the variables. We are thus finished with the
proof. D

MULTILINEAR FUNCTIONALS

Before looking for bases in V* Q9 W*, we define a bilinear functional 'Y Q9 A
for any two functionals 'Y E V* and A E W* by ('Y Q9 A)(~, '1/) = 'Y(~)A('1/).
We call 'Y Q9 A the tensor product of the functionals 'Y and Aand call any bilinear
functional having this form elementary. It is not too hard to see thatf E V* Q9 W*
is elementary if and only if the corresponding T E Hom(V, W*) is a dyad.
If V and Ware finite-dimensional, with dimensions m and n, respectively,
then the above isomorphism of V* Q9 W* with Hom(V, W*) shows that the
dimension of V* Q9 W* is mn. We now describe the basis determined by given
bases in V and W.
Theorem 1.2. Let {ai}'{' and {{jiH be any bases for V and W, and let their
dual bases in V* and W* be {Mi}'{' and {viH. Then the mn elementary
bilinear functionals {Mi Q9 Vi} form the corresponding basis for V* Q9 W*.
Proof· Since Mi Q9 Vi(~' '1/)

The set {Mi Q9 Vi} thus spans V* Q9 W*. Since it contains the same number of
elements (mn) as the dimension of V* Q9 W*, it forms a basis. 0
Of course, independence can also be checked directly. If Li,i tii(Mi Q9 Vi) =
0, then for every pair -<k, l>, tkl = Li,i tii(Mi Q9 Vi) (ak' (jl) = O.
We should also remark that this theorem is entirely equivalent to our
discussion of the basis for Hom(V, W) at the end of Section 4, Chapter 2.

not encountered in the bilinear case. However, it will not be necessary for us to
look into these questions.
We define elementary multilinear functionals as before. If Ai E vt, i =
1, ... , n, and E = -< h, ... , ~n >- , then

To keep our notation as simple as possible, and also because it is the case of
most interest to us, we shall consider the question of bases only when VI =
V 2 = ... = V n = V. In this case (V*)® = V* (8) ... (8) V* (in factors) is
called the space of covariant tensors of order n (over V).
If {aj}i is a basis for V and! E (V*)®, then we can eXlJand the value
!(E) = !(h, ... , ~n) with respect to the basis expansions of the vectors ~i just
as we did when! was bilinear, but now the result is notationally more complex.
If we set ~i = Li!=l x}aj for i = 1, ... , n (so that the coordinate set of ~i is
xi = {xJ} j) and use the linearity of the!(h, ... , ~n) in its separate variables one
variable at a time, we get
!(~l' ... , ~n) =

L

X!lX;2 ... x;J(aplI a p2, ... , a pn),

where the sum is taken over all n-tuples p = -< PI, ... , Pn >- such that 1 .:::; Pi .:::;
m for each i from 1 to m. The set of all these n-tuples is just the set of all functions from {I, ... , n} to {I, ... ,m}. We have designated this set mn , using the
notation n = {I, ... , n}, and the scope of the above sum can thus be indicated
in the formula as follows:
!(h, ... , ~n)

=

I:

X!l··· x;J(ap1 , ... , a pn)·

PEm1'

A strict proof of this formula would require an induction on n, and is left to the
interested reader. At the inductive step he wilt have to rewrite a double sum
LpE;nii LjEm as the single sum LqEm n+l using the fact that an ordered pair
-<p, j>- in mn X m is equivalent to an (n + 1)-tuplet q E mn+t, where qi = Pi
for i = 1, ... , nand qn+l = j.
If {,ui}i is the dual basis for V* and q E mn, let,uq be the elementary functional,uql (8) ... (8) ,uqn· Thus ,uq(apII ... , apJ = ll1,uqi(ap) = 0. unless p = q,
in which case its value is 1. More generally,
}Lq(h, ... , ~n) = ,uql (h) ... ,uqn (~n) = X!l ... x~n·
Therefore, if we set cq = !(a q1 , • .. , a qn ), the general expansion now appears as

f(~b ... , ~n)

or! = L ~, which is the same formula we obtained in the bilinear case, but
with more sophisticated notation. The functionals {,up: p E mn} thus span
(V*)®. They are also independent. For, if L Cp,lLp = 0., then for each q,
cq = L cp,lLp(a q1 , ... , aqJ = 0.. We have proved the following theorem.

3. PERMUTATIONS

A permutation on a set S is a bijection f: S - t S. If S(S) is the set of all permutations on S, then S = S(S) is closed under composition (u, pES = } u 0 pES)
and inversion (u E S = } u- I E S). Also, the identity map I is in S, and, of course,
the composition operation is associative. Together these statements say exactly
that S is a group under composition. The simplest kind of permutation other
than I is one which interchanges a pair of elements of S and leaves every other
element fixed. Such a permuation is called a transposition.
We now take S to be the finite set n = {I, ... ,n} and set Sn = Sen).
I t is not hard to see that then any permutation can be expressed as a product of
transpositions, and in more than one way.
A more elementary fact that we shall need is that if p is a fixed element of Sn,
then the mapping u I---t u 0 p is a bijection Sn I---t Sn. It is surjective because
any u' can be written u' = (u' 0 p-I) 0 p, and it is injective because UI 0 P =
U2 0 P = } (UI 0 p) 0 p-I = (U2 0 p) 0 p-l = } Ul = U2. Similarly, the mapping
U I---t P 0 U (p fixed) is bijective.
We also need the fact that there are n! elements in Sn. This is the elementary count from secondary school algebra. In defining an element U E Sn,
u(I) can be chosen in n ways. For each of these choices u(2) can be chosen in
n - 1 ways, so that -<u(I), u(2) >- can be chosen in n(n - 1) ways. For each of
these choices u(3) can be chosen in n - 2 ways, etc. Altogether u can be chosen
in n(n - I)(n - 2) ... 1 = n! ways.
In the sequel we shall often write 'pu' instead of 'p 0 u', just as we occasionally wrote 'ST' instead of'S 0 T' for the composition of linear maps.
If ~ = -< ~b ... , ~n >- E vn andu E Sn, then we can "apply u to ~", or "permute the elements of -< ~I' . . . ' ~n>- through u". We mean, of course, that
we can replace -< h, ... , ~n >- by -< ~.. (1}, ••• , ~.. (n) >-, that is, we can replace ~
by ~ 0 u.
Permuting the variables changes a functional f E (V*)@ into a new such
functional. Specifically, given f E (V*)@ and u E Sn, we define by

r

rw = fa

= fa..-I(}), ... , ~cr-I(n».

The reason for using u- 1 instead of u is, in part, that it gives us the following
formula.

Theorem 3.1. For each u in Sn the mapping Ttl defined by f f-+ r is a linear
isomorphism of (V*)@ onto itself. The mapping u f-+ Ttl is an antihomomorphism from the group Sn to the group of nonsingular elements of
Hom(V*)®).
Proof. Permuting the variables does not alter the property of multilinearity, so
Ttl maps (V*)® into itself. It is linear, since (af + bg)tI = ar + bgtl . And
Tptl = Ttl 0 Tp, becausef'tI = (f't. Thusu f-+ Ttl preserves products, but in the
reverse order. This is why it is called an antihomomorphism. Finally,

so that Ttl is invertible (nonsingular, an isomorphism). 0
The mapping u f-+ Ttl is a representation (really an antirepresentation) of the
group Sn by linear transformations on (V*)®.
Lemma 3.2. Each Ttl carries the basis {J.!p} into itself, and so is a permutation on the basis.
Proof. We have (J.!p)tI(l;) = J.!p(1; 0 u- 1) = II~=1 J.!Pi(~tI-l(i»' Settingj = u- 1 (i)
and so having i = u(j), this product can be rewritten IIi=l J.!p"r.;)(~j) = J.!potl(I;).

We consider now the special polynomial E on
E(x) = E(X1, ... , xn) =

~n

II

defined by
(Xi - Xj).

l~i<j~n

This is the product over all pairs -< i, j>- E n X n such that i < j. This set of
ordered pairs is in one-to-one correspondence with the collection P of all pair
sets {i, j} en such that i ~ j, the ordered pair being obtained from the unordered pair by putting it in its natural order. Now it is clear that for any
permutation u E Sn, the mapping {i, j} f-+ {u(i), u(j)} is a permutation of P.
This means that the factors in the polynomial EtI(x) = E(x 0 u) are exactly the
same as in the polynomial E(x) except for the changes of sign that occur when u
reverses the order of a pair. Therefore, if n is the number of these reversals, we
have Etl = (-1)nE. The mapping u f-+ (-I)n is designated 'sgn' (and called
"sign"). Thus sgn is a function from Sn to {I, -I} such that Etl = (sgnu)E,

Also
sgner = -1

This is clear if er interchanges adjacent numbers because it then changes th(~
sign of just one factor in E(x); we leave the general case as an exercise for the
interested reader.

Definition. A covariant tensor f E (V*)@ is antisymmetric or alternating if
!" = (sgn er)f for all er E Sn.

Since each er is a product of transpositions, this can also be expressed as th(,
fact that f just changes sign if two of its arguments are interchanged. In tIll'
case of a bilinear functional it is the conditionf(~, 1]) = -f(1] , ~) for all ~,1] E V.
It is important to note that iffis alternating, thenf(~) = 0 whenever the n-tupl('

symmetric elements of (V*)@ is clearly a subspace, as is also the (for us) mOJ"('

Lp cpJJ,pocr = Lp (sgn u)cpJJ,p for any U in Sn. Setting po U = q, the left sum

Cqocr-l = sgnucq or cp = (sgnu)cpocr for all p E m,'ii. Working backward, we see,
conversely, that this condition implies that:r = (sgn u)f. Thus 1 E an if and
only if its coordinate function cp satisfies the identity

This has many consequences. For one thing, cp = 0 unless p is one-to-one
(injective). For if Pi = Pi and U is the transposition interchanging i and j, then
p 0 U = p, cp = (sgn u)cpocr = -cp , and so cp = o. Since no p can be injective
if n > m, we see that in this case the only element of an is the zero functional.
Thus n > m =} dim an = o.
Now suppose that n :::; m. For any injective p, the set {p 0 U : U E Sn}
consists of all the (injective) n-tuples with the same range set as p. There are
clearly n! of them. Exactly one q = po U counts off the range set in its natural
order, i.e., satisfies ql < q2 < ... < qn. We select this unique q as the representative of all the elements p 0 U having this range. The collection C of these
canonical (representative) q's is thus in one-to-one correspondence with the
collection of all (range) subsets of m = {I, ... , m} of size n.
Each injective p E m,'ii is uniquely expressible as p = q 0 U for some q E C,
U E Sn. Thus each 1 in an is the sum LqEC LcrESn tqocrJJ,qocr. Since tqocr = (sgn u)tq,
this sum can be rewritten LqEC tq Lcr (sgn u)JJ,qocr = LqEC tqVq, where we have
Het Vq = Lcr (sgn u)JJ,qo(J' = n!Q(JJ,q).
We are just about done. Each Vq is alternating, since it is in the range of Q,
and the expansion

which we have just found to be valid for every 1 E an shows that the set
{vq : q E C} spans an. It is also independent, since LqEC tqVq = LpEmfi tpJJ,p
and the set {JJ,p} is independent. It is therefore a basis for an.
Now the total number of injective mappings p from n = {I, ... ,n} to
m = {I, ... ,m} is m(m - 1) ... (m - n 1), for the first element can be
chosen in m ways, the second in m - 1 ways, and so on down through n choices,
the last element having m - (n - 1) = m - n
1 possibilities. We have seen
above that the number of these p's with a given range is n!. Therefore, the
number of different range sets is

6. THE DETERMINANT

We saw in Section 5 that the dimension of the space am of alternating m-forms
over an m-dimensional V is (:) = 1. Thus, to within scalar multiples there is only
one alternating m-linear functional D over V = IR m , and we can adjust th(~
constant so that D(al, ... , am) = 1. This uniquely determined m-form is th(~
determinanifunctional, and its value D(xl, ... , xm) at the m-tuple -<Xl, ••• ,xm>is the determinant of the matrix x = {Xij} whoseJth column is x j for J = 1, ... , m.

any T in Hom V the functionalh defined by h(~l' ... , ~n) = f(T~l' ... , T~n)
also belongs to am. Since am is one-dimensional, h = krf for some constant k T .
Moreover, kT is independent of i, since if gT = kT' g and g = ci, we must havp
ch = kT' ci and kT' = k T. This unique constant is called the determinant of T;
we shall designate it !leT). Note that !leT) is defined independently of any basi::;

Proof. If f is any nonzero alternating m-form on W, and if we define g by
(J(h, ... , ~n) = f«(J~1l ... ,(J~n)' Then g is a nonzero alternating m-form on V.
Now f(S 0 (J~1l . . . ,S 0 (J~n) = fl.(S)f«(J~, ... , (J~n) = fl.(S)g(h, ... , ~n)'

linear combination of the others, tl = L;' Cit;, and D(tIl"" t m ) =

We still have to show that fl. has all the properties we ascribed to it in
Chapter 2. Some of them are in hand. We know that fl.(S 0 T) = fl.(S) fl.(T),
ILnd the one- and two-dimensional properties are trivial. Thus, if T interchanges
independent vectors al and a2 in a two-dimensional space, then its matrix with
respect to them as a basis is t = [~ Al, and so fl.(T) = D(t) = -1.
The following lemma will complete the job.
Lemma 6.2. Consider D(t) = D(t \ ... , t m) under the special assumption
that t m = om. If s is the (m - 1) X (m - 1) matrix obtained from the
m X m matrix t by deleting its last row and last column, then D(s) = D(t).

314

7.n

MULTILINEAR FUNCTIONALS

Proof. This can be made to follow from an inspection of the formula of LemmlL
6.1, but we shall argue directly.
If t has om also as its jth column for some j ~ m, then of course D(t) = (I
by the alternating property. This means that D(t) is unchanged if thejth columll
is altered in the mth place, and therefore D(t) depends only on the values iij ill
the rows i ~ m. That is, D(t) depends only on s. Now t ~ s is clearly a Slll'jective mapping to ~m-lXm-l, and, as a function of s, D(t) is alternatill~
(m - I)-linear. It therefore is a constant multiple of the determinant I)
on ~(m-l)X(m-l). To see what the constant is, we evaluate at

Then D(s) = 1 = D(t) for this special choice, and so D(s) = D(t) in general. [[
In order to get a hold on the remaining two properties, we consider all
m X m matrix t whose last m - n columns are on+ 1, .•• , om, and we apply
the above lemma repeatedly. We have, first, D(t) = D(t)mm), where (t)1II111
is the (m - 1) X (m - 1) matrix obtained from t by deleting the last rowalHl
the last column. Since this matrix has om-l as its last column (om-l being no\\'
an (m - I)-tuple), the same argument shows that its determinant is the salll('
as that of the (m - 2) X (m - 2) matrix obtained from it in the same way.
We can keep on going as long as the o-columns last, and thus see that D(t) is tll(·
determinant of the n X n matrix that is the upper left corner of t. If we interpret
this in terms of transformations, we have the following lemma.
Lenuna 6.3. 3uppose that V is m-dimensional and that T in Hom V iH

therefore follow from our above discussion if we can show that the matrix of

be able to see this if he visualizes what vector (p 0 T)(ai) is for i ::;; n. D

If the roles of X and Yare interchanged, both being invariant under T and
T being the identity on Y, then this same lemma tells us that Ll(T) = Llx(T

f X).

If we only know that X and Yare T-invariant, then we can factor T into

II

commuting product T = T loT 2 = T 2 0 T r, where T 1 and T 2 are of the two
more special types discussed above, and so have the rule Ll(T) = Ll(T 1 ) Ll(T 2 ) =
Llx(T f X) Lly(T f V), another of our properties listed in Chapter 2.

THE DETERMINANT

The final rule is also a consequence of the above lemma. If T is the identity
on X and also on V IX, then it isn't too hard to see that po (T f Y) is the
identity, as an element of Hom Y, and so A(T) = 1 by the lemma.
We now prove the theorem concerning "expansion by minors (or cofactors)".
Let t be an m X m matrix, and let (t)pr be the (m - 1) X (m - 1) submatrix
obtained from t by deleting the pth row and rth column. Then,
6.3. D(t) = L:i"=1 (-l)i+rtir D(t)ir). That is, we can evaluate
D(t) by going down the rth column, multiplying each element by the
determinant of the (m - 1) X (m - 1) matrix associated with it, and
Theorem

adding. The two occurrences of 'D' in the theorem are of course over dimensions m and m - 1, respectively.
Proof. Consider D(t) = D(tl, ... ,tm) under the special assumption that
op. Since D(t) is an alternating linear functional both of the columns of t
and of the rows of t, we can move the rth column and pth row to the right-

e=

bottom border, and apply Lemma 6.2. Thus
D(t)

= (_l)m-r(_l)m-p D(e r) = (-l)P+ rD(e r),

assuming that the rth column of t is or. In general, e = L:i"=1 tir oi, and if we
expand D(t t, ... , t m) with respect to this sum in the rth place, and if we use the
above evaluation of the separate terms of the resulting sum, we get D(t) =
L:i"=1 (_l)i+r tir D(t)ir. 0
Corollary 1. If S ~ r,

then

L:i"=1

(-l)i+rti. D(t)ir)

= o.

Proof. We now have the expansion of the theorem for a matrix with identicalsth
and rth columns, and the determinant of this matrix is zero by the alternating
property. 0

For simpler notation, set Cij = (-l)i+j D (t)ij). This is called the cofactor
of the element tij in t. Our two results together say that
m

L:

Cirti. = o~ D(t).

i=1

In particular, if D(t) ~ 0, then the matrix s whose entries are Sri = Cir/ D(t) is
the inverse of t. This observation gives us a neat way to express the solution of
a system of linear equations. We want to solve t . x = y for x in terms of y,
supposing that D(t) ~ O. Since s is the inverse of t, we have x = s' y. That is,
Xj = L:i"=1 SjiYi = (L:i"=1 YiCij)/ D(t) for J = 1, ... ,m. According to our
expansion theorem, the numerator in this expression is exactly the determinant
dj of the matrix obtained from t by replacing its Jth column by the m-tuple y.
Hence, with d j defined this way, the solution to t . x = y is the m-tuple

This is Cramer's rule. It was stated in slightly different notation in Section 2.5.

TheoreUl 7.3. Let () be the alternating n-linear map

from (v*)n to an. Then for any alternating n-linearfunctional F(AI' ... ,An)
on (v*)n, there is a uniquely determined linear functional G on an such that
F = Go e. The mapping G f---t F is thus a canonical isomorphism from
(an) * to an(V*).
Proof. The straightforward way to prove this is to define G by establishing its
necessary values on a basis, using the equation F = Go e, and then to show
from the linearity of G, the alternating multilinearity of

and the alternating multilinearity of F that the identity F = Go () holds
everywhere. This computation becomes notationally complex. Instead, we shall
be devious. We shall see that by proving more than the theorem asserts we get
a shorter proof of the theorem.
We consider the space an(V*) of all alternating n-linear functions on (v*)n.
We know from Theorem 5.2 that d(an(V*» = C;;'), since d(V*) = d(V) = m.

318

MULTILINEAR FUNCTIONALS

7.7

Now for each functional Gin (a n )*, the functional Go e is alternating and ulinear, and so G;-+ F = Go e is a mapping from (a n)* to an(v*) which is
clearly linear. Moreover it is injective, for if G ~ 0, then F(fJ-q(l), ... , fJ-q(n)) =
G(Vq) ~ 0 for some basis vector Vq = fJ-q(1) 1\ ... 1\ fJ-q(n) of an(v*). Sincp
d(an(V*) = ('::) = dean) = d(a n)*), the mapping is an isomorphism (by
the corollary of Theorem 2.4, Chapter 2). In particular, every F in an(v*) i::;
of the form Go e. 0

It can be shown further that the property asserted in the above theorem is
an abstract characterization of an. By this we mean the following. Suppose that
a vector space X and an alternating mapping cp from (v*)n to X are given, and
suppose that every alternating functional F on (v*)n extends uniquely to it
linear functional G on X (that is, F = Go cp). Then X is isomorphic to an, and
in such a way that cp becomes e.
To see this we simply note that the hypothesis of unique extensibility is
exactly the hypothesis that <I>: G;-+ F = Go cp is an isomorphism from X* to
an(v*). The theorem gave an isomorphism 8 from (a n)* to an(v*), and the
adjoint (<I>-1 0 8)* is thus an isomorphism from X** to (a n)**, that is, from X
to an. We won't check that cp "becomes" e.
By virtue of Corollary 1 of Theorem 6.2, the identity D(t) = D(t*) is the
matrix form of the more general identity b.(T) = b.(T*), and it is interesting to
note the "coordinate free" proof of this equation. Here, of course, T E Hom V.
We first note that the identity (T*A)(O = A(T~) carries through the definitions of @ and 1\ to give
T*Al 1\ ... 1\ T*An(~lI ... , ~n) = Al 1\ ... 1\ An(T~lI ... ,T~n).

(*)

Also, ev~: Al 1\ ... 1\ An;-+ Al 1\ ... 1\ An(~I' ... '~n) is an alternating
n-linear functional on an(v*) for each l; E V n. The left member of (*) is thus
ev~(T*Al' ... , T*An), and, if n = dim V, this is b.(T*)ev~(Al' ... , An) by the
definition of b.. By the same definition the right side of (*) becomes
b.(T)[AI 1\ ... 1\ An(~I' ... , ~n)l = b.(T)ev~(Al' ... , An).
Thus (*) implies the identity b.(T*)ev~ = b.(T)ev~. Since ev~ ~ 0 if l; =
Hi}! is independent, we have proved that b.(T*) = b.(T).
We call a wedge product Al 1\ ... 1\ An of functionals Ai E V* a multivector. We saw above that Al 1\ ... 1\ An ~ 0 if and only if {Ai}1 is independent, in which case {Ai}! spans an n-dimensional subspace of V*. The
following lemma shows that this geometric connection is not accidental.
Lemma 7.3. Two independent n-tuples {Ai}1 and {fJ-i}1 in V* have the
same linear span if and only if fJ-l 1\ ... 1\ fJ-n = k(AI 1\ ... 1\ An) for

some k.

Proof. If {fJ-j}! C L( {Ai}1), then each fJ-j is a linear combination of the A/S, and
if we expand fJ-l 1\ ... 1\ fJ-n according to these basis expansions, we get
k(Al 1\ ... 1\ An). If, furthermore, {fJ-i}1 is independent, then k cannot be zero.

Now suppose, conversely, that Jll /\ ... /\ Jln = kCAl /\ •.. /\ An), where
k ¢ O. This implies first that {Jli} 1 is independent, and then that
Jlj /\ (AI /\ ... /\ An)

= 0

for each j, so that each Jlj is dependent on {Ai}1. Together, these two consequences imply that the set {Jlin has the same linear span as {Ain. 0
This lemma shows that a multivector has a relationship to the subspace it
determines like that of a single vector to its span.
8. EXTERIOR POWERS OF SCALAR PRODUCT SPACES

Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space, and let ( , ) be a nondegenerate
(nonsingular) symmetric bilinear form on V. In this and the next section we shall
call any such bilinear form a scalar product, even though it may not be
positive definite. We know that the bilinear form ( , ) induces an isomorphism
of V with V* sending y E V into y E V*, where y(x) = (x, 'fi) = (x, y) for all
x E V. We then get a nondegenerate form (scalar product), which we shall continue to denote by ( , ), on V* by setting (ii, v) = (u, v). We also obtain a
nondegenerate scalar product on aq by setting
(iiI /\ ... /\ iiq , VI /\ ... /\ Vq ) = det (iii, VJ-).

(8.1)

To check that (8.1) makes sense, we first remark that for fixed Vb ... , Vq E V*,
the right-hand side of (8.1) is an antisymmetric multilinear function of the
vectors iiI, ... , iiq, and therefore extends to a linear function on aq(v*) by
Theorem 7.3. Similarly, holding the ii's fixed determines a linear function on
aq(v*), and (8.1) is well defined and extends to a bilinear function on aq(V*).
The right-hand side of (8.1) is clearly symmetric in U and v, so that the bilinear
form we get is indeed symmetric. To see that it is nondegenerate, let us choose a
basis Ul, . . . , Un so that
(8.2)
(We can always find such a basis by Theorem 7.1 of Chapter 2.) We know that
{iii} = {iii! /\ ... /\ iii.} forms a basis for aq, where i = <ib ... ,iq> ranges
over all q-tuplets of integers such that 1 ::::; i l < ... < i q ::::; n, and we claim
that
(8.3)
In fact, if i ¢ j, then ir ¢ js for some value of r between 1 and q and for aIls.
In this case one whole row of the matrix (Ui" Ujm) vanishes, namely, the rth row.
Thus (8.1) gives zero in this case. If i = j, then (8.2) says that the matrix has
±1 down the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, establishing (8.3), and thus the fact
that ( , ) is nondegenerate on aq • In particular, we have

Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space endowed with a nondegenerate scalar
product as in Section 8. The space an is one-dimensional if n is the dimension of
V. The induced scalar product on an is non degenerate, so that (u, u) is either
always positive or always negative for all nonzero u E an. In particular, there
are exactly two u's in an with (u, u) = ±l. Let us choose one of them and hold
it fixed for the remainder of this section. Geometrically, this amounts to choosing
an orientation on V. We thus have picked a

(9.1)

Let ii be some fixed element of a q. Then for any y E a n- q, ii /\ YEan, and so
we can write ii /\ Y = fv(Y)u, where fv(y) depends linearly on y. Since the
induced scalar product ( , ) on a n - q is nondegenerate, there is a unique
element *ii E a n- q such that (y, *ii) = hey). To repeat, we have assigned a
*ii E a n - q to each ii E aq by setting
(y, *ii)u = ii /\

y.

(9.2)

We have thus defined a map, *, from a q to a n - q • It is clear from (9.2) that this
map is linear. Let Ut, •.. , Un be a basis for V satisfying (8.2) and also u =
Ut /\ ••. /\ Un, and construct the corresponding bases for the spaces a q and
an - q • Then Ui /\ Uj = 0 if any i l occurring in the q-tuplet i also occurs in j.

INTEGRATION

1. INTRODUCTION

In this chapter we shall present a theory of integration in n-dimensional Euclidean space lEn, which the reader will remember is simply Cartesian n-space
IRon together with the standard scalar product. Our main item of business is to
introduce a notion of size for subsets of lEn (area in two dimensions, volume in
three ... ). Before proceeding to the formal definitions, let us see what properties
we would like our notion of size to have. We are looking for a function jJ. which
assigns a number jJ.(A) to bounded subsets A C P.
i)

We would like jJ.(A) to be a nonnegative real number.

ii) If AC B, we would expect to have jJ.(A) ::; jJ.(B).
iii) If A and B are disjoint (that is, A n B =
have jJ.(A U B) = jJ.(A) + jJ.(B).

0), then we would expect to

iv) Let T be any Euclidean motion. * For any set A let T A be the set of all
points of the form Tx, where x E A. We then would expect to have
jJ.(T A) = jJ.(A). (Thus we want "congruent" sets to have the same size.)
v) We would expect a "lower-dimensional set" (where this is suitably defined) to have zero size. Thus points in the line, curves in the plane,
surfaces in three-space, etc., should all have zero size.
vi) By the same token, we would expect open sets to have positive size.
In the above discussion we did not specify what kind of sets we were talking
about. One might be ambitious and try to assign a size to every subset of lEn.
This proves to be impossible, however, for the following reason: Let U and V
be any two bounded open subsets of IE 3. It can be shown t that we can find

* Recall that a Euclidean motion is an isometry of lEn and can thus be represented as
the composition of the translation and an orthogonal transformation.

and

n U; = 0 = Vi n V; for i ¢ j, and Euclidean motions Ti with
TiU i = Vi. In other words, we can break up U into finitely many pieces, move

with U,

these pieces around, and then recombine them to get V. Needless to say, the
sets U i will have to look very bad. A moment's reflection shows that if we wish
to assign a size to all subsets (including those like U i ), we cannot satisfy (ii) ,
(iii), (iv), and (vi). In fact, (iii) [repeated (k - I) times] implies that
k

p,(U) =

:E p,(Ui ),
i=1

and (iv) implies that p,(Ui ) = p,(Vi ). Thus p,(U) = p,(V), or the size of any two
open sets would coincide. Since any open set contains two disjoint open sets,
this implies, by (ii), that p,(U) ? 2p,(U), so p,(U) = O.
Weare thus faced with a choice. Either we dispense with some of requirements (i) through (vi) above, or we do not assign a size to every subset of lEn.
Since our requirements are reasonable, we prefer the second alternative. This
means, of course, that now, in addition to introducing a notion of size, we must
describe the class of "good" sets we wish to admit.
We shall proceed axiomatically, listing some "reasonable" axioms for a class
of subsets and a function p,.
2. AXIOMS

Our axioms will concern a class :D of subsets of lEn and a function p, defined on :D.
(That is, p,(A) is defined if A is a subset of lEn belonging to our collection :D.)
I. :D is a collection of subsets of P such that:

Before proceeding, some remarks about our axioms are in order. Axiom:D1
will allow us to perform elementary set-theoretical operations with the elements
of :D. Note that in Axioms :D2 and p,3 we are only allowing translations, but in

llIuclidean motions in (iv). The reason for this is that we shall show that for
B~good" choices of :0, the axioms, as they stand, uniquely determine J.I.. It will
'lhen turn out that J.I. actually satisfies the stronger condition (iv) , while we
Issume the weaker condition J.l.3 as an axiom.

Axiom :03 guarantees that our theory is not completely trivial, i.e., the
t}bllection :0 is not empty. Axiom J.l.4 has the effect of normalizing J.I.. Without it,
tf¥ly J.I. satisfying J.l.l, J.l.2, and J.l.3 could be multiplied by any nonnegative real
"1;tumber, and the new function J.I.' so obtained would still satisfy our axioms.
flh particular, J.l.4 guarantees that we do not choose J.I. to be the trivial function
:lSSigp.ing to each A the value zero.

Fig. 8.2

Our program for the next few sections is to make some reasonable choices for
.:0 and to show that for the given:o there exists a unique J.I. satisfying J.l.l through J.l.4.
An important elementary consequence of the :0, J.I.-axioms that we shall fre-

quently use without comment is:

Our beginning work will be largely combinational. We will first consider
(generalized) rectangles, which are just Cartesian products of intervals, and the
iway in which a point inside a rectangle determines a splitting of the rectangle
,.into a collection of smaller rectangles, as indicated in Fig. 8.1. This is associated
with the fact that the intersection of any two rectangles is a rectangle and the
difference of two rectangles is a finite disjoint union df rectangles (see Fig. 8.2).

Fig. 8.3

We call a set A paved if it can be expressed as the union of a finite disjoint
collection p of rectangles (a paving of A). It will follow from our combinational
considerations that the collection !Dmin of all the paved sets satisfies Axioms !Dl
through !D3 and is the smallest family that does: any other collection !D satisfying
the axioms includes !Dmin. It will then follow that if M satisfies Ml through M4 on
!Dmin, then it must have the natural value (the product of the lengths of the sides)
for a rectangle. This implies that M is uniquely defined on !Dmin by requirements
Ml through M4, since the value M(A) for any paved set A must be the sum of the
natural values for the rectangles in a paving of A. The existence of M on !Dmin
thus depends on the crucial lemma that two different pavings of the set A give
the same sum. (See Fig. 8.3.)
This comes down to the fact that the "intersection" of two pavings of A is
a third paving "finer" than either, and the fact that when a single rectangle is
broken up, the natural values of M for the pieces add up to M for the fragmented
rectangle.
All these considerations are elementary but exceedingly messy in detail. We
give the proofs below for the reader to refer to in case of doubt, but he may
prefer to study only the definitions and statements of results and then to proceed
to Section 6.
3. RECTANGLES AND PAVED SETS

We first introduce some notation and terminology. Let a = -< a \ ... , an >and b = -<bI, ... , bn >- be elements of lEn. By the rectangle D~ we shall mean

In the plane (n = 2) for instance, our rectangles D~ correspond to ordinary
Euclidean rectangles whose sides are parallel to the axes. (We should perhaps use
an additional adjective and call our sets level rectangles, braced rectangles, or
something else, but for simplicity we shall just call them rectangles.) Note that
in the plane our rectangles include the left-hand and lower edges but not the
right-hand and upper ones (see Fig. 8.4).

to get the correct geometrical feeling.) Note that the case where O~ n O~ = >Z5
is included in (3.3) by (3.2). Another immediate consequence of the definition
(3.1) is
for any translation T.
(3.4)
We will now establish some elementary results which will imply that any ::0
satisfying Axioms ::01 through ::03 must contain all rectangles.
Lemma 3.1. Any rectangle O~ can be written as the disjoint union
where

(What this says is that any "big" rectangle can be written as a finite union
of "small" ones.)
Proof. We may assume that O~ ~ >Z5 (otherwise take k = 0 in the union).
Thus bi > a i . In particular, if we choose the integer m sufficiently large,
(1/2m)(b - a) will lie in O~.
By induction, it therefore suffices to prove that we can decompose O~ into
the disjoint union

(For then we can continue to subdivide until the rectangles we get are small
enough.)
We get this subdivision in the obvious way by choosing the vertex "in the
middle" of the rectangle and considering all rectangles obtained by cutting
D~ through this point by coordinate hyperplanes. To write down an explicit

Do = D~ n D~-l'

Let Tv denote translation through the vector v. Then D~-l = Tc - l D~ by

paved sets. Let i>min denote the collection of all finite unions of rectangles;
then i>min satisfies Axioms i>1 through i>3.

Proof. We have already proved the first part of this proposition. We leave the

second part as an exercise for the reader.

AxiomM4 says that (4.1) holds for the special case a = 0, b = 1. Examining
the proof of Lemma 3.1 shows that D~ can be written as the disjoint union of 2n
rectangles, all congruent (via translation) to D~12, where i = (!, ... , !).
Axioms M2 and M3 then imply that

M(D~12) =

Repeating this argument inductively shows that

We shall now use (4.2) to verify (4.1). The idea is
to approximate any rectangle by unions of translates of cubes

Observe that in proving (4.1) we need to consider only rectangles of the form

We first introduce some notation.
Definition 5.1. A paving p of lEn is a finite collection of mutually disjoint

rectangles. The floor of this paving, denoted by [pI, is the union of all
rectangles belonging to p.
If p = {D~:} and T is a translation, we set Tp = {TD~:}.
If p and g are two pavings, we say that g is finer than p (and write g -< p)
if every rectangle of p is a union of rectangles of g. It is clear that if p -< 9:/
and g -< p, then g -< 9:/. Note also that g -< P implies [p[ C [gr.
Proposition 5.1. Let p and g be any two pavings.

There exists a third

g.

Proof. The idea of the proof is very simple. Each rectangle in p or in g determines 2 n hyperplanes (each hyperplane containing a face of the rectangle).
If we collect all these hyperplanes, they will "enclose" a number of rectangles.
We let 9:/ consist of those rectangles in this collection which do not contain any
smaller rectangle. Figure 8.7 shows the case (for n = 2) where p and g each
contain one rectangle. Here 9:/ contains nine rectangles.
We now fill in the details of this argument. Let Cl = -< cL ... , c~ >- , ... ,
Ck =
-< ck, ... , Ck>- be all the vectors that occur in the description of the
rectangles of p and g. (In other words, if D~ E: P or E: g, then a and b are among
the c's.) Let d 1 , . . • , dk n be the vectors of the form -<
cin >-, where the i/s
range independently from 1 to k, (so that there are kn of them). (See Fig. 8.8 for
the case where n = 2 and p and g consist of one rectangle each.) For each d i
there is at most one smallest dj(i) such that d i < dj(i)' In fact, if

Then lsi = Ipil U· .. u Ipkl. D

In particular, we have proved (1). More generally, we have shown that every

CONTENTED SETS

Summing over all D~: (and doing the same for D~l) proves (5.2). We can thus
state:
TheoreD1 5.1. Every A E :Dmin can be written as A = Ipl. The number
JL(A) = LOEPJL(O) does not depend on the choice of p. We thus get a
well-defined function JL on :Dmin. It satisfies Axioms JL1 through JL4. If JL' is
any other function on :Dmin satisfying JL2 and JL3, then JL'(A) = KJL(A),
where K = JL'(O~).

Proof. The proof of the last two assertions of the theorem is easy and is left as an
exercise for the reader.
6. CONTENTED SETS

Theorem 5.1 shows that our axioms are not vacuous. It does not provide us
with a satisfactory theory, however, because :Dmin contains far too few sets.
In particular, it does not fulfill requirement (iii), since :Dmin is not invariant
under rotations, except under very special ones. We are now going to remedy
this by repeating the arguments of Section 4; we are going to try to approximate
more general sets by sets whose JL'S we know, i.e., by sets contained in :Dmin.
This idea goes back to Archimedes, who used it to find the areas of figures in
the plane.
Definition 6.1. Let A be any subset of lEn. We say that P is an inner paving

of A if

Ipi CA.

We say that S is an outer paving of A if A

We list several obvious facts.

Observe that every A E ~min is contented. In fact, if A = lvi, then v is
both an inner and an outer paving of A. Thus J-t*(A) = ,ileA) = J-t(lvl), and the
new definition of J-t(A) coincides with the old one.
Our next immediate objective is to show that the collection of all contented
sets fulfills Axioms ~1 through ~3.
Proposition 6.1. A set A is contented if and only if its boundary is con-

tented and has content zero.
Proof. Suppose A is contented. For any 0 > 0 we can find an inner paving p
and an outer paving S such that J-t(S) - J-t(p) < 0/2. We want to replace p by
a close paving p' with Ip'l c int A. To do this, we choose a small number 1/
and replace each rectangle D~ of p by D~+~~~=:~. We let p~ be the collection
of all these rectangles. Then Ip~1 C int Ipl, so Ip~1 C int A. Furthermore,
J-t(lp~l) = (1 - 21/)nJ-t(lpl), since the factor (1 - 21/) is the decrease of each side
of each rectangle of p. Similarly, we replace S by a slightly larger s~, with
A C int S~ and J-t(S~) :::; (1 + 21/)nJ-t(S). By choosing 1/ sufficiently small, we
can thus arrange that J-t(S~) - J-t(p~) < o. Let v be a paving which is finer
than S~ and p~, with Ivl = Is~l. Let.4- C v consist of those rectangles of 'V
lying in int A. Then Ivl = Is~1 =:> 1.4-1 =:> Ip~l, so J-t(lvl) - J-t(I.4-I) :::; o. But,
aA c Iv - .4-1, so that ,il(aA) :::; J-t(lv - .4-1) = J-t(lvl) - J-t(I.4-1) < o. In other
words, ,il(aA) = o.
Conversely, suppose that aA has content zero. Let.4- be an outer paving of
aA with J-t(I.4-1) < E. Let v be a paving finer than .4- and such that A C Ivl.
Let p C v consist of those rectangles contained in A. Let S C v consist of those
rectangles lying in Ipi U 1.4-1. ThenJ-t(lsl) :::; J-t(lpl) +J-t(I.4-1) < J-tCipl) + E. Furthermore, A C lsi. In fact, let x E A. Then xED for some 0 E v. If 0 n aA ~
0, then 0 n 1.4-1 ~ 0, so 0 c 1.4-1, since v is a refinement of.4-. If 0 n aA = 0,
then every point of 0 must lie in A, so that 0 C Ipl. We have thus constructed
p and S with Ipi cAe lsi and J-t(S) - J-t(p) < E. Since we can do this for any f,
this implies that A is contented. D
Proposition 6.2. The union of any finite number of sets with content zero

Hence A u B and A n B are contented.

implies that p,'(lpl) ~ p,'(A) ~ p,'(18!). Since we can choose p and 8 to be
arbitrarily close approximations to A (relative to p,), we are done. 0

If we combine (7.2) and (7.3), we see that any cube G lies in a ball B such
that fl(B) S 2n(Vn)np.(G) and that any ball B lies in a cube G such that p.(G) <
3n(yn)nfl(B).

Let A be a subset of lEn. Then A has content zero if and only
if for every E > 0 there exist a finite number of balls {Bi} covering A
with L fl(Bi) < E.
Lelllllla 7.1.

Proof. If we have such a collection of covering balls, then by the above remark
we can enlarge each ball to a rectangle to get a paving p such that A C Ipi and
p.(lpl) < 3n(yn)nE. Therefore, fleA) = 0 if we can always find the {B i }.
Conversely, suppose A has content O. Then for any 0 we can find an outer
paving p with p.(lpl) < o. For each rectangle 0 in the paving we can, by thp
arguments of Section 4, find a finite number of cubes which cover 0 and whose
total content is as close as we like to p.(O), say <2p.(O). By doing this for each
E p, we have a finite number of cubes {Oi} covering A with total content
less than 20. Then by our remark before the lemma each cube O. lies in a ball
Bi such that P.(Oi) < 2n(Vn)nfl (B.), and so we have a covering of A by balls Bi
such that L fl(Bi) < 2n+ 1 (yn)n o. If we take 0 = E/2n+ 1 (yn)n, we have the
desired collection of balls, proving the lemma. 0

content zero, for any E > 0 we can find a finite number of balls covering A whose
total outer content is less than E/Kn. By (7.4), cp(B~) C B:[,.), so that the images
of the balls covering A cover cp(A) and have a total volume less than E. 0
Recall that if cp is a (continuously) differentiable map of an open set U into
lEn, then cp satisfies a Lipschitz condition on any compact subset of U.
As a consequence of Proposition 7.1, we can thus state:
Proposition 7.2. Let cp be a continuously differentiable map defined on an

open set U, and ld A be a bounded set of content zero with
cp(A) has content zero.

Proposition 7.4. Let A C P be such that aA c UI/;i(B i ) where each I/;i and

Bi is as in Proposition 7.3. Then A is contented.

Proposition 8.1. Let ~ be a one-to-one map of U ~ P which satisfies a
Lipschitz condition and is such that ~-l is continuous. If A c U is contented, then so is ~(A).

Proof. Since A is contented, aA has content zero. By the conditions on ~,
we know that a~(A) = ~(aA). Thus a~(A) has content zero, and so ~(A) is
contented. 0
An immediate consequence of Proposition 8.1 is:
Proposition 8.2. Let L be a linear transformation of P. Then LA is con-

tented whenever A is contented.
Proof. If Lis nonsingular, Proposition 8.1 applies. If L is singular, it maps all
of lEn onto a proper subspace. Any such subspace is contained in the image of
{x : xn = O} by a suitable linear transformation, and so p.(LA) = 0 for any
contented A. 0
Theorem 8.1. Let L be a linear transformation of P. Then for any contented A we have
(8.1)
p.(LA) = Idet LIp.(A).

Proof. We can restrict our attention to nonsingular L, since we have already
checked Eq. (8.1) for det L = o. If L is nonsingular, then L carries the class of

contented sets into itself. Let us define fJ.' by fJ.'(A) = fJ.(LA) for each A E :Deon .
We claim that fJ.' satisfies Axioms fJ.1 through fJ.3 on :Deon .
In fact, fJ.1 and fJ.2 are obviously true; fJ.3 follows from the fact that for any
translation Tv, we have T LvL = LTv, so that
fJ.'(TvA)

=

fJ.(LTvA)

=

fJ.(TLvLA)

=

fJ.(LA) = fJ.'(A).

By Theorem 5.2 we thus conclude that
fJ.'

= kLfJ.,

where kL is some constant depending on L. We must show that kL = Idet LI.
We first observe that if 0 is an orthogonal transformation, then
fJ.(OA) = fJ.(A).

In fact, we know that fJ.(OA) = kOfJ.(A). If we take A to be the unit ball B~,
then OB~ = B~, so ko = l.
Next we observe that fJ.(L I L 2 A) = k L1 fJ.(L 2 A) = k L JCL 2 fJ.(A), so that

Now we recall that any nonsingular L can be written as L = PO, where P
is a positive self-adjoint operator and 0 is orthogonal. Thus kL = k p and
Idet LI = Idet PI Idet 01 = Idet PI, so we need only verify (S.l) for positive selfadjoint linear transformations. Any such P can be written as P = OID01 \
whe~e 0 1 is orthogonal and D is diagonal. Since P is positive, all the eigenvalues
of D are positive. Since det P = det D and k p = kD, we need only verify (S.U
for the case where L is given by a diagonal matrix with positive eigenvalues

9. AXIOMS FOR INTEGRATION

SO far we have shown that there is a unique fJ. defined for a large collection of
sets in lEn. However, we do not have an effective way to compute fJ., except in
very special cases. To remedy this we must introduce a theory of integration.
We first introduce some notation.
Definition 9.1. Let f be any real-valued function on lEn. By the support of
j, denoted by supp j, we shall mean the closure of the set where j is not zero;
that is,
suppj = {x: j(x) rf O}.

8.9

AXIOMS FOR INTEGRATION

Observe that
supp (f

+ g) C supp f

U supp g

337

(9.1)

and
supp fg

c supp f n supp g.

(9.2)

We shall say that f has compact support if supp f is compact. Equation (9.1)
[and Eq. (9.2) applied to constant gj shows that the set of all functions with
compact support form a vector space.
Let T be any one-to-one transformation of lEn onto itself. For any function f
we denote by Tf the functions given by

(Tf)(x)

=

f(T-1x).

(9.3)

Observe that if T and T- 1 are continuous, then
supp Tf

=

T supp f.

(9.4)

Definition 9.2. Let A be a subset of lEn. By the characteristic function of A,
denoted by eA, we shall mean the function given by

if x E A,
if xtiA.

(9.5)

Note that

eA l nA 2 = eAl . eA 2 ,
eA l UA 2 = eAl + eA 2 - eA l nA 2 ,
supp eA = X,

(9.6)
(9.7)
(9.8)

and
(9.9)

for any one-to-one map T of lEn onto itself.
By a theory of integration on P we shall mean a collection 5' of functions
and a rule I which assigns a real number If to each f E 5', subject to the following axioms:
5'1. 5' is a vector subspace of the space of all bounded functions of compact

support.
5'2. If f E 5' and T is a translation, then Tf E 5'.

5'3. eo belongs to 5' for any rectangle
I is a linear function on 5'.
I2. ITf = If for any translation T.
I3. Iff ~ 0, then If ~ O.

I4. IeD~ = 1.
Note that the axioms imply that 5' contains all functions of the form

Also note that from I3 we have at once the stronger version:
I3'. f:::; g = } If :::; I g, since then g - f ~ O.
Proposition 9.1. Let a:,

II through I4. Then

I be a system satisfying Axioms n

JeA = ,u(A)

through a:3 and
(9.10)

for every contented set A such that eA E a:, and
I5. IIfl :::; IIflloo,u(suppf) for every f Ea:.
Proof. The axioms guarantee that eA E a: for every A E !Dmin and that v(A) =
I eA satisfies ,u1 through ,u4. Therefore, I eA = ,u(A) for every A E !Dmin by the
uniqueness of ,u (Proposition 4.1). It follows that if A is a contented set such
that eA E a:, and if p and s are inner and outer pavings of A, then
,u(lpi)

=

Je 1,,1 :::; JeA :::; Je lsi = ,u(jsi).

Therefore, I eA lies between ,u*(A) and ,a(A), and so equals ,u(A). For any
f E a: and any A E !Dmin such that supp f ~ A, we have -llfll",eA :::; f :::;
IIfll",eA, and therefore IIfl :::; IIfll",,u(A) by I3' and (9.10). Taking the greatest
lower bound of the right side over all such sets A, we have I5. 0
10. INTEGRATION OF CONTENTED FUNCTIONS

We will now proceed to deal with Axioms a: and I in the same way we dealt
with Axioms !D and,u. We will construct a "minimal" theory and then get a "big"
one by approximating. According to Proposition 9.1, the class a: must contain
the function e 1,,1 for any paving p. By a:1 it must therefore contain all linear
combinations of such.
Definition 10.1. By a paved function we shall mean a function f = f"

given by
(10.1)
for some paving p.
It is easy to see that the collection of all paved functions satisfies Axioms n
through 53. Furthermore, by Proposition 9.1 and Axiom II the integral, I, is
uniquely determined on the class of all paved functions by

(10.2)
if f is given by (10.1).
The reader should verify that if we let a:p be the class of all paved functions
and let I be given by (10.2), then all our axioms are satisfied. Don't forget to
show that I is well defined: if f is expressed as in (10.1) in two ways, then the
sums given by (10.2) are equal.

8.10

INTEGRATION OF CONTENTED FUNCTIONS

The paved functions obviously form too small a collection of functions.
We would like to have an 5' including all continuous functions with compact
support and all characteristic functions of the form eA with A contented, for
example.
Definition 10.2. A bounded function f with compact support is said to be
contented if for any e > 0 and a > 0 there exists a paved function g = g.,a
and a contented set A = A.,a such that

If(x) - g(x) I
and

<

,u(A)

The pair -< g, A

>-

for all

e

x (/. A

(10.3)

< a.

(10.4)

will be called a paved e, a-a pproxima tion to f.

Let us verify that the collection of all contented functions, 5'con, satisfies
Axioms 5'1 through n. It is clear that iffis contented, so is affor any constant a.
If fl and f2 are contented, let -<gb Al >- and -<Y2, A 2 >- be paved e,a-approximations to fl and f2' respectively. Then
for all x (/. Al U A 2,
and

+

+

Thus -<gl
g2, Al U A 2 >- gives a paved 2e, 2 a-approximation tofI
12.
To verify 5'2 we simply observe that if -< g, A>- is a paved e, a-approximation
to f, then -< Tg, T A >- is one to Tf.
A similar argument establishes the analogous result for multiplication:
Proposition 10.1. Let fI and f2 be two contented functions.

Then fd2 is

contented.

Proof. Let M be such that Ifl(X) < M and If2(X)1 < M for all x. Recall that
the product of two paved functions is a paved function. Using the same notation
as before, we have
Ifl12(X) - gl(X)g2(X)1 :::; IfI(x)llf2(X) - g2(x)1
< Me + (M e)e
Thus -<glg2, Al U A 2 >-

+ Ig2(X)llfl(X) -

gl(x)1

+
is a paved (2M + e)e, 2a-approximation tofd2'

D

As for 5'3, it is immediate that a stronger statement is true:
Proposition 10.2. If B is a contented set, then eB is a contented function.

Proof· In fact, let p be an mner paving of B with ,u(B) - ,u(lpl)
eB(x) - e II'I (x)

and

We now establish a useful alternative characterization of a contented function.
Proposition 10.3. A function f is contented if and only if for every E there
are paved functions hand k such that h :::; f :::; k and I (k - h) < E.

Proof. Iff is contented, let R be a rectangle including supp f. Let -< g, A>- be an
E, a-approximation to f. Let P be a paved set including A = A.,5 such thai.
p,(P) < a, and let m be a bound of If I· Then g - E(eR) - mep :::; f :::; g -+

and I(k - h) < a, then the set where k - h 2:: a l/2 is a paved set A. Furthermore, a 1/2p,(A) :::; IeA(k - h) :::; I(k - h) :::; a, so that p,(A) :::; a 1/2 . Given E
and a, we only have to choose a :::; min (E2, a2 ) and take g as either k or h to sec
that f is contented. 0

Corollary. A function f is contented if for every E there are contented

Theorem. 10.1. Let 5' be a class of functions satisfying Axioms

Proof. If I is any integral on 5' satisfying Axioms II through I4, then we must
have If simultaneously equal to lub Ih for h paved and :::;f and equal to glb I Ie

If = lub I h = glb I k, then Axioms II through I4 follow from the fact that
they hold for the uniquely determined integral on the paved functions. 0
Let f and g be contented functions such that f(x) = g(x) for x tl. A,
where J.t(A) = O. Then Jf = Jg. (This shows that for the purpose of integration
we need to know a function only as to a set of content zero.)

INTEGRATION OF CONTENTED FUNCTIONS

We close this section by giving another useful characterization of contented
functions.
Proposition 10.4. Let f be a bounded function with compact support.
Then f is contented if and only if to every E > 0 and ~ > 0 we can find an
1/ > 0 and a contented set Aa such that ,u(Aa) < ~ and

Then let f •. 2a(x) = f(Xi) when x E Di, where Xi is some point of Di. By (ii)
and (iii), we see that f •. 2a,ISI is a paved E, 2~-approximation to f. Thus f is
contented.
Conversely, suppose that f is contented,
and letf./2.a/2, A./ 2 •a/ 2 be a paved approximation to f.
Let p = {Di} be the paving associated
with f./2.aj2. Replace each Di by the rectangle D~ obtained by contracting Di about
its center by a factor (1 - ~). (See Fig. 8.10.)
Thus ,u(DD = (1 - ~)n,u(Di). For any x,

But the third term vanishes, so that if(x) - f(y) I < E. Now by first choosing ~
sufficiently small, we can arrange that ,u(lpl - UDD < ~/2. Then we can
choose 1/ so small that IIx - yll < 1/ implies that x, y belong to the same D~ if
x, y E UD~. For this 1/ and for Aa = A./ 2 •a/ 2 U (ipi - UDD, Eq. (10.7) holds,

11. THE CHANGE OF VARIABLES FORMULA

This section will be devoted to the proof of the following theorem, which is of
fundamental importance.
Theorem 11.1. Let U and V be bounded open sets in IRn, and let !p be a
continuously differentiable one-to-one map of U onto V with !p - 1 differentiable
Let f be a contented function with supp f C V. Then (f !p) is a contented function,

(11.1 )

Recall that if the map cp is given by yi = cpi(Xl, ... , xn), then J I" is th(~
linear transformation whose matrix is [acpi/aXj).
Note that if cp is a nonsingular linear transformation (so that JI" is just cp),
then Theorem 11.1 is an easy consequence of Theorem 8.1. In fact, for functions
of the form CA we observe that CA 0 cp = CI"-lA, and Eq. (11.1) reduces, in this
case, to (8.1). By linearity, (11.1) is valid for all paved functions.
Furthermore,fo cp is contented. Suppose If(x) - f(y) I < Ewhen IIx - yll <
cp and x, y tl A, with ,u(A) < o. Then If 0 cp(u) - f 0 cp(v) I < E when
and

u, v tl cp-l(A),

with ,u(cp-l A) < o/Idet cpl.
Now let g•. ~, A •. ~ be an approximating family of paved functions for f. Theil
Ifo cp(x) - g•. ~ 0 cp(x) I < eforx tl cp-l(A •. ~) and,u(cp-lA •. ~) < o/Idet cpl. Thus
I(g •. ~ 0 cp)ldet cpl - t I(fo cp)ldet cpl, and Eq. (11.1) is valid for all contentedf.
The proof of Theorem 11.1 for nonlinear maps is a bit more tricky. It consists essentially of approximating cp locally by linear maps, and we shall do it ill
several steps. We shall use the uniform norm IIxli ao = max IXil on ~n. This is
convenient because a ball in this norm is actually a cube, although this nicety
isn't really necessary.

In practice, we sometimes may apply Eq. (11.1) to a situation where the
hypotheses of Theorem 11.1 are not, strictly speaking, verified. For instance, in
1R2 we may want to introduce "polar coordinates". That is, we let r, be coordinates on 1R2; if S is the set 0 ::; < 21r,0 ::; r, we consider the map cp: S ~ 1R2
given by x = r cos 0, y = r sin 0, where x, yare coordinates on a second copy
of \R 2 • Now this map is one-to-one and has positive Jacobian for r > O. If we
consider the open sets U C S given by 0 < r, 0 <
21r and V C \R 2 given by

V = \R - {x, y : y = 0, x ~ O}, the hypotheses of Theorem 11.1 are fulfilled,

theorem of the calculus reduces the computation of the integral of a function to
the computation of its antiderivative. The generalization of this theorem to
n dimensions will be presented in a later chapter. In this section we will show
how, in many cases, the computation of an n-dimensional integral can be reduced
to n successive one-dimensional integrations.
Suppose we regard IR n , in some fixed way, as the direct product IRn =
IRk X 1R1. We shall write everyz E IRn as z = -<x, y>, where x E IRk and y E IR/.
Definition: 12.1. We say that a contented function f is contented relative to
the decomposition IRn = IRk X IRI if there exists a set AI C IRk of content

zero (in IRk) such that

on IRI;

~

A" the function f(x, .) is a contented function

ii) the function IRlf which assigns to x the number IRlf(x, .) is a contented
function on IRk.
It is easy to see that the set of all such functions satisfies Axioms 5'1 through
5'3. (The only axiom that is not immediate is 5'2. But this is an easy consequence
of the fact that any translation T can be rewritten as TIT2 ,where Tl is a translation in IRk and T2 is a translation in 1R1.)
It is equally easy to verify that the rule which assigns to any such f the
number

for any rectangle (direct verification). Thus, by the uniqueness part of Theorem
10.1, we have

Note, in particular, that if f is also contented relative to the decomposition
IRn = IRI X IRk, then

In particular, for such f the double integration is independent of the order.

Observe that in the definition of center of gravity we obtain a vector (i.e., a point

13. ABSOLUTELY INTEGRABLE FUNCTIONS

Thus far we have been dealing with bounded functions of compact support. In
practice, we would like to be able to integrate functions which neither are
bounded nor have compact support. Let f be a function defined on lEn, let M be
a nonnegative real number, and let A be a (bounded) contented subset of lEn.
Let If be the function
if x El A,
if x E A and If(x) I > M,
If(x) =
f(x)
if x E A and If(x) I ~ M.

{~

Thus If is a bounded function of compact support. It is obtained from f by
cutting f back to zero outside A and cutting f back to M when If(x) I > M.
We say that a function f is absolutely integrable if
i) If is a contented function for all M > 0 and contented sets A; and
ii) for any E > 0 there is a bounded contented set A. such that eA • • f is
bounded and for all M > 0 and all B with B n A. = >0,

<

JlfWI

E.

It is easy to check that the sum of two absolutely integrable functions is again
absolutely integrable. Thus the set of absolutely integrable functions forms a
vector space. Note that if f satisfies condition (i) and If(x) I < Ig(x)1 for all x,
where g is absolutely integrable, then f is absolutely integrable.
Let f be an absolutely integrable function. Given any E, choose a corresponding A.. Then for any numbers M I and M 2 ~ maXxEA. If(x) I and for any sets
Al ~ A. and A2 ~ A.,

If we let E ~ 0 and choose a corresponding family of A., then the above inequality implies that the lim ffA. is independent of the choice of the A •. We define
this limit to be ff.
We now list some very crude sufficient criteria for a function to be absolutely
integrable. We will consider the two different causes of trouble-nonboundedness and lack of compact support.
Let f be a bounded function with fA contented for any contented set A.
Suppose If(x) I ::; Cllxll-k for large values of Ilxll. Let Br be the ball of radius r
centered at the origin. If TI is large enough so that the inequality holds for
IIxll ~ Tb then for T2 ~ TI we have

which is ~ [Cln/(k - n)lr~-k, which tends to zero as r1
we can assert:

Let f be a bounded function such that fA is contented for any contented
set A. Suppose that If(x)1 ---+ 0 as Ilxll ---+ 00 in such a way that Ilxllklf(x)1 is
bounded for some k > n. Then f is absolutely integrable.
N ow let us examine the situation when f is of compact support but unbounded. Suppose first that there is a point Xo such that f is bounded in the
complement of any neighborhood of Xo. Suppose, furthermore, that
If(x)1 ~ Ckllx - xoll- k
for some constants C and k. Then if If(x) I > 111, Ilx - xoll- k > M/C or
IIx - xoll < C/MI/k.
Let B1 be the ball of radius CM 1I / k centered at Xo. Then If(x)1 > M1
implies that x E B 1. Furthermore, for M 2 > M 1 we have

where B2 is the ball of radius CM-;I/k centered at Xo. Thus

which can be made arbitrarily small by choosing M 1 large.
Thus if f has compact support and is such that fM is contented for all M and
If(x) I < Cllx - xoll- k with k < n, thenfis absolutely integrable.
More generally, let S be a bounded subset of an l-dimensional subspace of
lEn. Let d(x) denote the distance from x to S. Let f be a function of compact
support with fM contented for all M. If If(x) I < C d(x)-k with k < n - l,
then f is absolutely integrable. The proof is similar to that given above and is left
to the reader.
Let Uk} be a sequence of absolutely integrable functions. Under what
conditions will the sequence f f n ---+ f f if the sequence A(x) ---+ f(x)? Even if the
sequence converges uniformly, there is no guarantee that the integrals converge.
For instance, if fk = (l/kn)eD~, then Ifk(X)1 ~ l/k n, so that fk approaches zero
uniformly. On the other hand, ffk = 1 for all k.

8.13

ABSOLUTELY INTEGRABLE FUNCTIONS

353

We say that a set of functions Uk} is uniformly absolutely integrable if for
any E > 0 there is an A. which can be chosen independently of k such that
for all M
wherever B n A. = 0.
We frequently verify that {ik} is uniformly absolutely integrable by showing
that there is an absolutely integrable function g such that Ifk(X)1 ~ Ig(x)1 for
all k and x.
Let Uk} be a uniformly absolutely integrable sequence of functions. Suppose
that fk ~ f uniformly. Suppose in addition that f is absolutely integrable. Then
Ifk ~ If. In fact, for any 0 > 0 we can find a ko such that Ifk(X) - f(x) I < 0
for all k > ko and all x. We can also find A. and M. such that

which can be made arbitrarily small by first choosing E small (which then gives
an A.) and then choosing 0 small (which means choosing ko large).
The main applications that we shall make of the preceding ideas will be to
the problems of computing iterated integrals and of differentiating under the
integral sign.
Proposition 13.1. Let f be a function on ~k X ~l. Suppose that the set of
functions U(x, .)} is uniformly absolutely integrable, where x is restricted
to lie in a bounded contented set K C ~k. Then the function eKXRI. f is
absolutely integrable, and

Proof. To show that (f 0 tp)ldet J <pI is absolutely integrable, let E > 0 and

If f is a Coo-function of compact support, then (14.1) obviously holds, so
f E s. A more instructive example is provided by the function n given by
n(x) = e-lIxIl2 •

Since limT--->oo r P e- r2 = 0 for any p, it follows that limllxll--->oo a(x)n(x) = o. On
the other hand, it is easy to see (by induction) that Dan(x) = Pa(x)n(x) for

of size, where now s can be an arbitrary real number.

We now define the space H8 to be the completion of S under the norm II II.. The

CHAPTER 9

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

Thus far our study of the calculus has been devoted to the study of properties
of and operations on functions defined on (subsets of) a vector space. One of
the ideas used was the approximation of possibly nonlinear functions at each
point by linear functions. In this chapter we shall generalize our notion of space
to include spaces which cannot, in any natural way, be regarded as open subsets
of a vector space. One of the tools we shall use is the "approximation" of such a
space at each point by a linear space.
Suppose we are interested in studying functions on (the surface of) the unit
sphere in 1E3. The sphere is a two-dimensional object in the sense that we can
describe a neighborhood of every point of the sphere in a bicontinuous way by
two coordinates. On the other hand, we cannot map the sphere in a bicontinuous
one-to-one way onto an open subset of the plane (since the sphere is compact and
an open subset of 1E2 is not). Thus pieces of the sphere can be described by open
subsets of 1E2, but the whole sphere cannot. Therefore, if we want to do calculus
on the whole sphere at once, we must introduce a more general class of spaces
and study functions on them.
Even if a space can be regarded as a subset of a vector space, it is conceivable
that it cannot be so regarded in any canonical way. Thus the state of a (homogeneous ideal) gas in equilibrium is specified when one gives any two of the three
parameters: temperature, pressure, or volume. There is no reason to prefer any
two to the third. The transition from one set of parameters to the other is given
by a one-to-one bidifferentiable map. Thus any function of the states of the
gas which is a differentiable function in terms of one choice of parameters is
differentiable in terms of any other. Thus it makes sense to talk of differentiable
functions on the states of the gas. However, a function which is linear in terms
of one choice of parameters need not be linear in terms of the other. Thus it
doesn't really make sense to talk of linear functions on the states of the gas.
In such a situation we would like to know what properties of functions and what
operations make sense in the space and are not artifacts of the description we
give of the space.
Finally, even in a vector space it is sometimes convenient to introduce
"nonlinear coordinates" for the solution of specific problems: for example, polar
coordinates in Exercises 11.3 and 11.4, Chapter 8. We would therefore like to
know how various objects change when we change coordinates and, if possible,
to introduce notation which is independent of the coordinate system.

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

We will begin our formal discussion with the definition of differentiable
manifolds. The basic idea is ~imilar to the one that is used in everyday life to
describe the surface of the earth. One gives a collection of charts describing small
overlapping portions of the globe. We can piece the whole picture together by
seeing how the charts match up.

Let M be a set. Let V be a Banach space. (For almost all our applications we
shall take V to be IRn for some integer n.) A V-atlas of class Ck on M is a collection a of pairs (Ui , l{Ji) called charts, where U i is a subset of M and l{Ji is a bijective map of Ui onto an open subset of V subject to the following conditions

Note that the atlas we gave for the sphere contains only two charts (each
given by polar projection). An atlas of the earth usually contains many more
charts. In other words, many different atlases can be used to describe the same
set. We shall return to this point later.

The circle. The circle 8 1 is a "one-dimensional sphere" and therefore
has an atlas as described in Example 2. We wish to describe a different atlas
on 8 1 . Regard 8 1 as the unit circle x~ + x~ = 1, and consider the function 8b
defined in a neighborhood of < 1, 0> on the upper semicircle of 8 1, which gives
the angle from the point on 8 1 to < 1, 0> (see Fig. 9.3). As we move counterclockwise around the circle, this function is well defined until we hit < 1, >
again. We will take, as the first chart in our atlas, (U 1 , 81), where U 1 =
8 1 - {< 1,0>} and 81 is the function defined above. Let U 2 = 8 1 - {<o, I>},
and define 82 to be 7r /2 plus the angle (measured counterclockwise) from
<0,1> (see Fig. 9.4).
Now U 1 n U 2 = 8 1 - {<1,0>, <0, I>}, and
8 1 (U 1 n U 2 ) = (0,27r) - {7r/2}.

Banach spaces. Then the collection e = {( U i X V j, 'Pi X 1/1 j)} is a (V 1 X V 2)atlas on M X N. Here 'Pi X 1/Ij(p, q) = < 'Pi(P) , 1/Ii(q) > if <p, q> E Ui X Wj.
lt is easy to check that e satisfies conditions Al and A2. We shall call e the
product of a and <B and write e = a X <B.
For instance, let M = (0,1) C 1R1 and N = 8 1 • Then we can regard
M X N as a cylinder or an annulus. If M = N = 81, then M X N is a torus.

It is an instructive exercise to write down the atlases and transition functions
explicitly in these cases.
ExaDlple 5. As a generalization of our first example, let S be a submanifold of
an (n m)-dimensional vector space X, as defined in Section 12 of Chapter 3.
For each neighborhood N defined there, the set S n N, together with the map l{J
which is defined as the projection 1r1 restricted to S, provides a chart with
values in V (where X is viewed as V X W). In such a neighborhood N the set S
is presented as a graph of function F. In other words,

+

SnN= {-<x,F(x)~ EVX W:XE1r1(S)},

where F is a smooth map of A = 1r1(S n N) into W. Let N' be another such
neighborhood with corresponding projection 1r~ (where now X is identified with
V X W in some other way). Then l{J' 0 l{J-1(X) = 1r~(x, F(x»), which shows
that l{J' 0 l{J-1 is a smooth map. Thus every submanifold in the sense of Chapter 3
possesses an atlas.
Exercise. Let!P" (projective n-space) denote the space of all lines through the origin

if they differ by a factor, that is, yi = AX' for all i, where A is some (nonzero) real
number. We can thus regard an element of !P" as an equivalence class of nonzero

9.2

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

Returning to the general discussion, we observe that the functions fi are
not completely independent of one another. In fact, it follows from the definition (2.1) that we have

Ii <Pi <pjl = I;
0

0

on

<Pj(Ui

n Uj).

(2.2)

[Thus in the example cited above we indeed have f2(Y) = fl(y/llyI12), as is
required by (2.2).]
We now come to a simple but important observation. Suppose we start
with a collection of functions {fi}, eachfi defined on <Pi(Ui), and such that (2.2)
holds. Then there exists a unique function f on M such that Ii = f 0 <pil. In
fact, define f by setting f(p) = fi (<Pi(p) if p E U i. For f to be well defined, we
must be sure that this definition is consistent, i.e., that if p is also in Uj, then
fi(<Pi(p) = I;(<pj(p), but this is exactly what (2.2) says.
We can thus think of a real-valued function in two ways: as either
i) an object defined invariantly on M, i.e., a map from M to ~, or
ii) a collection of objects (in this case functions) one defined for each chart
and satisfying certain "transition laws", namely (2.2).
This dual way of looking at objects on M will recur quite frequently in what
follows.
Let M be a set with an atlas of class Ck • We will say that a function f is of
class C l (l ~ k) if each of the functions Ii defined by (2.1) is of class C l • Note
that since l ~ k, this can happen without any interference from (2.2). If Ii E Cl
and <pil 0 <Pj E Ck (k ~ l), then fi 0 (<pi l 0 <Pj) E C l. If l were larger than k,
then in general fi would not be of class Cl if I; were, and there would be very
few functions of class Cl •
Since we will not wish to constantly specify degrees of differentiability of
our atlas, from now on when we speak of an atlas we shall mean an atlas of class Coo.
Let M be a set with an atlas <t. We shall say that a sequence of points
{Xi E M} converges to X E M if
i) there exists a chart (U i , <Pi) E a and an integer Ni such that X E U i and
for all k > N, Xk E Ui ;
ii) <Pi(Xkh>N converges to <p(x).
Note that if (Uj, <pj) is any other chart with X E Uj, then there exists an N j
such that <Pj(Xk) E U j for k > N j and <Pj(Xk) ---? <pj(x). In fact, choose N j so
that <Pi(Xk) E <Pi(Ui n Uj) for all k ~ N j. (This is possible since <Pj(Ui n Uj)
is open by AI.) The fact that the <Pj(Xk) converge to <Pj(x) follows from the
continuity of <Pj 0 <pil. It thus makes good sense to say that {Xk} converges to x.
Warning. It does not make sense to say that a sequence {Xk} is a Cauchy
sequence. Thus, for example, let M = sn with the atlas described above. If {Xk}
is a sequence of points converging to the north pole in sn, then <PI (Xk) ---? 0,
while <P2(Xk) ---? 00. This example becomes even more sticky if we remove the
north pole, i.e., let M = sn - {-< 0, ... , 0, 1 > } and define the charts as before.

9.3

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

Then {Xk} has no limit (in M). Clearly,
{IP2(Xk)} is not.

{IP1 (Xk)}

369

is a Cauchy sequence, while

Once we have a notion of convergence, we can talk about such things as
open sets and closed sets. We could also define them directly. For instance, a set
U is open if IPi(U n U i ) is an open subset of IPi(Ui ) for all charts (U i , IPi), and so on.

EXERCISES

2.1 Show that the above definition of a set's being open is consistent, i.e., that there
exist nonempty open sets. (In fact, each of the U/s is open.)
2.2 Show that a sequence {xc>} converges to x if and only if for every open set U
containing x there is an Nu with Xc> E U for a > Nu.

Let a = {CUi, IPi)} be an atlas on M, and let U be an open subset of M relative
to this atlas. Let a f U be the collection of all pairs (Ui n U, IPi f U). It is
easy to check that a f U is an atlas on U. We shall call it the restriction of
a to U.
Let f be a function defined on the open set U. We say that f is of class Cl
on U if it is of class Cl relative to the atlas (1, f U on U. For later convenience
we shall say that a function f defined on a subset of M is of class Cl if
i) the domain of f is some open set U of M, and
ii) f is of class Cion U.

3. DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

In our discussion of the examples in Section 1, the particular choice of atlas that
we made in each case was rather arbitrary. We could equally well have introduced a different atlas in each case without changing the class of differentiable
functions, or the class of open sets, or convergent sequences, and so on. We
therefore introduce an equivalence relation between atlases on M:
Let (1,1 and (1,2 be atlases on M. We say that they are equivalent if their
union (1,1 U (1,2 is again an atlas on M.
The crucial condition is that Al still hold for the union. This means that
for any charts (U i , IP;) E (1,1 and (Wi> "'j) E (1,2 the sets IPi(Ui n Wj) and
"'j(U i n Wj) are open and IPi 0 ",;1 is a differentiable map of "'j(U i n Wj) onto
IPi(Ui n Wj) with a differentiable inverse.
It is clear that the relation introduced is an equivalence relation. Furthermore, it is an easy exercise to check that if f is a function of class Cl with respect
to a given atlas, it is of class Cl with respect to any equivalent one. The same is
true for the notions of open set and convergence.

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

Definition 3.1. A set M together with an equivalence class of atlases on M is
called a differentiable manifold if it satisfies the "Hausdorff property": For any
two points Xl ¢ x2 ofM there are open sets Uland U2 with Xl E UI andX2E U2 with
UI n U2 = 0.
In what follows we shall (by abuse of the language) denote a differentiable
manifold by M, where the equivalence class of atlases is understood. By an
atlas of M we shall then mean an atlas belonging to the given equivalence class,
and by a chart of M we shall mean a chart belonging to some atlas of M.
We sha.ll also adopt the notational convention that V is the Banach space
where the charts on M take their values (and shall say that M is a V-manifold).
If there are several manifolds, M 1, M 2, etc., under discussion, we shall denote
the corresponding vector spaces by VI, V 2, etc. If V = Rn, we say that M is
an n-dimensional manifold.
Let M 1 and M 2 be differentiable manifolds. A map cp: M 1 ~ M 2 is called
continuous if for any open set U 2 eM 2 the set cp-1(U 2) is an open subset of MI'
Let X2 E M 2, and let U 2 be any open set containing X2' If CP(X1) = X2, then
cp-1(U 2) is an open set containing Xl. If (W, a) is a chart about Xl, then
W n cp-1(U 2) is an open subset of W, and a(W n cp-1(U 2») is an open set in VI
containing a(xI)' Therefore, there exists an E > 0 such that cp(x) E U 2 for all
X E W, with Ila(x) - a(xl)1I < E. In this sense, all points "close to Xl" are
mapped "close to X2". Note that the choice of E will depend on the chart (W, a)
as well as on Xb X2, U 2, and cpo
If M b M 2, and M 3 are differentiable manifolds, and if cp: M 1 ~ M 2 and
"': M 2 ~ M 3 are continuous maps, it is easy to see that their composition
'" 0 cp is a continuous map from M 1 to M 3'
Let cp be a continuous map from M 1 to M 2. Let (W b aI) be a chart on M 1
and (W 2, (2) a chart on M 2. We say that these charts are compatible (under cp)
if cp(W 1) c W 2. If a 2 is an atlas on M 2 and al is an atlas on M b we say that al
and a2 are compatible under cp if for every (W b al) E al there exists a
(W 2, (2) E a 2 compatible with it, i.e., such that cp(W 1) c W 2. (Note that the
map a2 0 (cp f WI) 0 all is then a continuous map of an open subset of VI into
V 2') Given a 2 and cp, we can always find an al compatible with a2 under cpo
In fact, let a'l be any atlas on M b and set
al

{(WI n cp-I(W 2»), a

f (WI n cp-l(W 2»)},

where (W 11 a) ranges over all charts of a'i and (W 2, (3) ranges over all charts
of a2.
Definition 3.2. Let M 1 and M 2 be differentiable manifolds, and let cp be a

map: MI .!4 M 2 • We say that cp is differentiable if the following hold:
i) cp is continuous.
ii) Let a l and a 2 be compatible atlases under cpo Then for any compatible

In order to check that a continuous map tp is differentiable, it suffices to
check much less than (ii). Condition (ii) relates to any pair of compatible atlases
and any pair of compatible charts. In fact, we can assert:
Proposition 3.1. Let tp: M 1 -+ M 2 be continuous, and let (11 and (12 be
compatible atlases under tp. Suppose that for every (WI, aI) E a l there
exists a (W 2, (2) E (12 with tp(W 1) c W 2 and a2 0 tp 0 a'i'"1 differentiable.
Then tp is differentiable.

Proof. Let (U 1, (31) and (U 2, (32) be any charts on M 1 and M 2 with tp(U 1) C U2'
We must show that f32 0 tp 0 f31 1 is differentiable. It suffices to show that it is
differentiable in the neighborhood of every point f3(XI), where Xl E U l' Choose
(W 1, aI) E (11 with X E W 11 and choose (W 2, aI) E a2 with tp(W 1) C W 2'

4. THE TANGENT SPACE

In this section we are going to construct an "approximating vector space" to a
differentiable manifold at each point of the manifold. This will allow us to
formulate most of the notions of the differential calculus on manifolds.
Let 111 be a differentiable manifold, and let x be a point of 111 (Fig. 9.6).
Lei I C IR be an interval containing the origin. Let <p be a differentiable map
of I into 111 such that <p(O) = x. We will call <p a (differentiable) curve through x.
Let f be any differentiable real-valued function on 111 defined in a neighborhood of x. Then <p*[fl is differentiable on IR and we can consider its derivative
at the origin. Define the operator D", by

In view of the linearity of <p*, the map
f ~ D",(f) is linear:

Similarly, we have Leibnitz's rule:

which can easily be checked. The functional D", depends on the curve <po If 'if;

say that the curves <p and 'if; are tangent at x, and we write <p ,...., 'if;. Thus
D",(f) = D",(f)

if and only if

for all differentiable functions f.

It is easy to check that,...., is an equivalence relation. An equivalence class
of curves through x will be called a tangent vector at X. If ~ is a tangent vector
at x and <p E ~, we say that ~ is tangent to <p at X.
For any differentiable function f defined about x and any tangent vector ~,

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

If we set <I> = a 0 cp and F = f 0 a-I, then <I> is a parametrized curve in a Banaeh
space and F is a differentiable function there. We can thus write

D",(f) = dF(<I>'(O))

=

D~'(o)F.

From this expression we see (setting '11 = a 0 if;) that if; '" cp if and only if
<1>'(0) = '11'(0). We thus see that in terms of a chart (W, a), every tangent.
vector ~ at x corresponds to a unique vector ~O! E V given by
~a = (a 0 cp),(O),
where cp E ~.
Conversely, given any v E V, there is a tangent vector ~ with ~O! = /'
In fact, define cp by setting cp(t) = a-I (a(x)
tv). Then cp is defined in a sma.ll
enough interval about 0, and (a 0 cp)' = v.
In short, a choice of chart allows us to identify the set of all tangent vector:;

where J -y(p) is the differential dY p of Y at p.
Since J{3oa-1(a(x)) is a linear map of V into itself, Eq. (4.3) says that tIl('

This says that if we identify T x(M 1) with VI via a and identify T y,(x)(M 2) with
V 2 via (3, then 1/Iu becomes identified with the linear map JIJoy,oa-1(a(x»). In
particular, the map t/I*x is a continuous linear mapping from Tx(M 1) to T y,(x)(M 2)'
If cp: M 1 -+ M 2 and t/I: M 2 -+ M 3 are two differentiable mappings, then it
follows immediately from the definitions that

(4.4)

We have seen that the choice of chart (U, a) identifies Tx(M) with V.
Now suppose that M is actually V itself (or an open subset of V) regarded as a
differentiable manifold. Then M has a distinguished chart, namely (M, id).
Thus on an open subset of V the identity chart gives us a distinguished way of
identifying Tx(M) with V. It is sometimes convenient to picture Tx(M) as a
copy of V whose origin has been translated to x. We would then draw a tangent
vector at x as an arrow originating at x. (See Fig. 9.8.)
Now suppose that M is a general manifold and that 1/1 is a differentiable map
of M into a vector space VI' Then 1/1* (Tx(M») is a subspace of TY,lX)(V 1),
If we regard t/I*(Tx(M» as a subspace of VI and consider the corresponding
hyperplane through x, we get the "plane tangent to 1/I(M) at x" in the intuitive
sense (Fig. 9.9).

a = {(Ub 81), (U 2 , 82 )}, the map cp is given by

x = <1,0>- and ta = 1l'/2, then x f1. U 1 and cp(x, 1l'/2) f1. U 2. This is e~sily
remedied by the introduction of a third chart.) It is easy to see that cp is a oncparameter group.
Example 4. Let M = 8 1 X 8 1 be the torus, and let a and b be real numbers.
Write x E M as x = <Xb X2>-, where Xi E 8 1• Define cp<a,b> by

where cpa and cpb are given in Example 3. Then cp<a,b> is a one-parameter group
and indeed a rather instructive one. The reader should check to see that essentially different behavior arises according to whether b/a is rational or irrational.
[The construction of Example 4 from Example 3 can be generalized as
follows. If cp: M X ~ ~ M and 1/1: N X ~ ~ N are one-parameter groups,

Example 1, the linear transformation A in Example 2, the real number a ill
Example 3, and the pair < a, b>- in Example 4. We will now show that associated
with anyone-parameter group on a manifold, there is a nice object which we
can regard as the infinitesimal generator of the one-parameter group.

In view of condition (ii), we know that <;?x(O) = x. Thus <;?x is a curve passing
through x (see Fig. 9.13). Let us denote the tangent to this curve by X(x).
We thus get a mapping X which assigns to each x E M a vector X(x) E TxCM).
Any such map, i.e., any rule assigning to each x E M a vector in Tx(M), will be
called a vector field. We have seen that everyone-parameter group gives rise to a
vector field which we shall call the infinitesimal generator of the one-parameter
group.

Let Y be a vector field on M, and let (U, a) be a chart on M. For each
x E U we get a vector Y(x)a E V. We can regard this as defining a V-valued
function Y a on a (U) :
Ya(v)

=

Y(a-l(v))a

for

v E a(U).

(5.1)

Let (W, (3) be a second chart, and let Y~ be the corresponding V-valued function
on (3(W). If we compare (5.1) with (4.3), we see that
Y~({3

(5.2)

Equation (5.1) gives the "local expression" of a vector field with respect to a
chart, and Eq. (5.2) describes the "transition law" from one chart to another.
Conversely, let a be an atlas of M, and let Y a be a V-valued function defined
on a(U) for each chart (U, a) E a. Suppose that the Y a satisfy (5.2). Then for
each x E M we can let Y(x) E Tx(M) be defined by setting
Y(x)a =

Ya(a(x))

for some chart (U, a) about x. It follows from the transition law given by (4.3)
and (5.2) that this definition does not depend on the choice of (U, a).
Observe that J~oa-l is a COO-function (linear transformation-valued function)
on a(U n W). Therefore, if Y is a vector field and Y a is a V-valued COO-function
on a(U), the function Y~ will be Coo on (3(U n V). In other words, it is consistent
to require that the functions Y a be of class Coo. We shall therefore say that Y

is a COO-vector field if the function Y a is Coo for every chart (U, a). As in the casl'
of functions and mappings, in order to verify that Y is Coo, it suffices to check that
the Y a are Coo for all charts (U, a) belonging to some atlas of M.
Let us check that the infinitesimal generator X of a one-parameter group <{'

This shows that X is a Coo-vector field.
If we evaluate (5.3) in the case of Example 1, we get <I>id(V, t) = v + tll',
so that X id = w. In the case of Example 2 we !!:et Xid(V) = Av.
There are various algebraic operations that can be performed with vector
fields. The set of all vector fields on M forms a vector space in the obvious way.
If X and Yare Coo-vector fields, then so is aX

(aX + bY)(x) = aX(x) + bY(x),

Similarly, we can multiply a vector field by a function. If f is a function and X
is a vector field, we define fX by
(fX)(x)

It is easy to see that if f and X are differentiable, then so is fX. It is also easy
to check the various associative laws for this multiplication.
We have seen that anyone-parameter group defines a smooth vector field.
Let us examine the converse. Does any Coo-vector field define a one-parameter
group? The answer to the question as stated is "no".
In fact, let X = a/ax l be the vector field corresponding to translation in the
xl-direction in ~n. Let M = ~2 - C, where C is some nonempty closed set.
of ~n. Then if p is any point of M that lies on a line parallel to that xl-axis which
intersects C (Fig. 9.14), then IPt(p) will not be defined (will not lie in M) for
every t.
The reader may object that M "has some
points missing" and that is why X does not
generate a one-parameter group. But we can
construct a counterexample on ~2 itself. In
fact, if we consider the vector field X on ~2
given by
Xid(X I , x 2) = (1, _(X2)2),

Definition 5.1. A flow on 111 is a map cp of an open set U C 111 X IR ---t 111
such that
i) 111 X {O} C U;
ii) cp is differentiable;
iii) cp(x, 0) = x;
iv) cp(cp(x, s), t) = cp(x, s t) whenever both sides of this equation are
defined.

+

For x fixed, CPx(t) = cp(x, t) is defined for sufficiently small t, so that cp gives
rise to a vector field X as before. We shall call X the infinitesimal generator
of the flow cpo
As the previous examples show, there may be no t ~ 0 such that cp(x, t) is
defined for all x, and there may be no x such that cp(x, t) is defined for all t.
Proposition 5.1. Let X be a smooth vector field on 111. Then there exists a
neighborhood U of 111 X {O} in 111 X IR and a flow cp: U ---t 111 having X as
its infinitesimal generator.

Proof. We shall first construct the curve CPx(t) for any x E M, and shall then
verify that -< x, t>- f-+ cp(x, t) is indeed a flow.
Let x be a point of 111, and let (U, a) be a chart about x. Then Xa gives us
lfn ordinary differential equation in a(U), namely,
dv

v E a(U).

and

Here the choice of the open set 0 and of f depends on a(x) and a(U). The
uniqueness part of the theorem asserts that <Pa is uniquely determined up to the
domain of definition; i.e., if <Pv is any curve defined for It I < f' with <pv(O) = v
and
d<Pv(t) = X (<p (t»)

then <pv(t) = <pa(v, t).
This implies that
<pa(V, t

<pa(<pa(v, s), t)

Consider the curve <1>'\(,) defined by
<1>'\(t)

=

a -l(<I>a(a(x),t)).

(5.5)

It is defined for It I < E, and is a continuous, in fact differentiable map of this
interval intoM. Furthermore, if we write IjJ = <1> ax O then (5.4) asserts that the
tangent vector to the curve ljJ(t + .) isX(IjJ(t)), the value of the vector field at the
point ljJ(t). We will write this condition as
1jJ,(t)

=

X(IjJ(t)).

(5.6)

Equation (5.6) is the way we would write the "first order differential equation"
on M corresponding to the vector field X. A differentiable curve IjJ satisfying
(5.6) is called an integral curve of X. We now can formulate a manifold version
of the uniqueness theorem of differential equations:
Lemma 5.1. Let 1\11:1---'> M and 1\12:1 ---'> M be two integral curves of X defined on
the same interval I. If 1\11 (8) = 1\12(8) at some point 8 E Ithen 1\11 = 1\12, i.e. 1\11 (t) =
1\12(t) for all tEl.

Proof We wish to show that the set where IjJl(t)

ii) using the Hausdorff property of manifolds to show that IjJl (t +) = 1jJ2(t +).

Details: i). Suppose that 1\11 (t +) = 1\12(t +) = Y EM. We can find a coordinate
chart (13, W) abouty, and then 13 a 1\11 and 13 a 1\12 are solutions of the same system
of first order ordinary differential equations, and they both take on the value
13(Y) at t = t +. Hence, by uniqueness for differential equations, 13 a 1\11 and 13 a 1\12
must be equal in some interval about t +, and hence 1\11 (t) = 1\12(t) for all t in this
interval. This is impossible since there must be points: arbitrarily close to t +
where 1\11(t) ;t.! 1\12(t) by the glb property of t +. This proves i). Now suppose that
1\11 (t +) ;t.! 1\12(t +). We can find neighborhoods U 1of 1\11 (t +) and U 2 of 1\12(t +) such
that U1 n U2 = 0. But then the continuity of the 1\11 imply that 1\11 (t) E Uland
1\12(t) E U2 for t close enough to t+, and hence that I\Il(t) ;t.! 1\12(t) for t in some
interval about t +. This once again contradicts the glb property of t +, proving
ii). The same argument with glb replaced by lub shows that B is empty proving
Lemma 5.1. The above argument is typical of a "connectedness argument."
We showed that the set where I\Il(t) = 1\12(t) is both open and closed, and hence
must be the whole interval I.
Lemma 5.1 shows that (5.5) defines a solution curve of X passing through
x at time t = 0, and is independent of the choice of chart in any common
interval of definition about o. In other words it is legitimate to define the curve
<Px(-) by
which defines <px(t)for It I < E. Unfortunately the E depends not only on x but
also on the choice of chart. We use Lemma 5.1 and extend the definition of <Px(·)
as far as possible, much as we did for ordinary differential equations on a vector
space in Chapter 6: For any S with Is I < Ewe lety = <Px(s) and obtain a curve
<Py(.) defined for It I < E'. By Lemma 5.1
<Py(t)

= <pX<s+t)ifls+tl <

E.

(5.7)

It may happen that Is I + E' > E. Then there will exist a t with It I < E' and
E. Then the right hand side of (5.7) is not defined, but the left is. We
then take (5.7) as the definition of <Px(s + t), extending the domain of definition
of <Px(-). We then continue: Let Ix + denote the set of all s > 0 for which there
exists a finite sequence of real numbers So = 0 < SI < ... < Sk = s and points
Xo, . • • Xk-l E M with Xo = x, SI in the domain of definition of <Px(·), X2 = <Px(SI)
and, inductively,

Tt,

= <Pxj(Si+ 1).

+

so is Sf for 0 < Sf < s, and so is s TJ for sufficiently small
positive TJ. Thus rt is an interval, half open on the right. By repeated use of
(5.4) we define IPx(s) for s E Tt We construct r; in a similar fashion and
set Ix = It u r;. Then IPx(s) is defined for s E Ix, and I is the maximal
interval for which our construction defines IPx. For each x E M we obtain an
open interval I x in which the curve IPx(·) is defined.
Let U = UXEM{X} X Ix. Then U is an open subset of M X I. To verify this,
let (x, 8) E U. We must show that there is a neighborhood W of x and an E > 0
such that s E I x for all Is - 81 < E and x E W. By definition, there is a finite

defined.

Example 2. Let Xid(V) = Av, where A is a linear transformation, and let
Y id = w. Then (6.10) says that
[X, Yhd(V) = -Aw,

since the directional derivative of the linear function Av with respect to w is Aw.
Example 3. Let Xid(V) = Av and Yid(V) = Bv, where A and B are linear
transformations. Then by (6.10),
[X, Yjid(V) = BAv - ABv = (BA -

AB)v.

(6.12)

Thus in this case [X, Yj again comes from a linear transformation, namely,
BA - AB. In this case the antisymmetry in A and B is quite apparent.
We now return to the general case. Let cp be a one-parameter group on M,
let Y be a smooth vector field on M, and let I be a differentiable function on M.

Let M be a differentiable manifold. We have attached to each x EM a vector space
Tx(M). Its dual space, (Tx(M»*, is called the cotangent space to M at x, and will be
denoted by T:(M). Thus an element ofT:(M) is a continuous linear function on Tx(M);
it is called a covector.
Some explanation of the word "continuous" is in order. In the case where
M [and hence Tx(M)] is finite-dimensional, all linear functions on Tx(M) are
continuous, so no further comment is necessary. We shall be concerned primarily
with this case. More generally, let l be a linear function on Tx(M). For any

chart (U, a) about x we have identified Tx(M) with V, thus identifying ~ E Tx(M)
with ~a E V. Then 1 determines a linear function la on V by
(7.1)
If (W, 13) is a second chart, then
<~fj, lfj) = <Jaofj-l({3(X))~fj, la).

Since J aorl ({3(x)) is a continuous map of V into V, we see that la is continuous
if and only if lfj is. We shall therefore say that 1 is continuous if la is continuous
for some (and hence any) a. In this case we see that (7.1) gives us an identification of T:(l\[) with V* sending 1 into lao The last equation says that the rule
for change of charts is given by
(7.2)
Let f be a differentiable function on M, and let x EM. Then the function
on Tx(M) sending each ~ E Tx(M) into Hf) will be denoted by df(x). Thus
<~, clf(x)

= U·

It is easy to see that df E T:(l\[). In fact, in terms of a chart (U, a) about x,
<~, df(x)

=

D~(fa) (a(x)).

Note that f assigns an element df(x) of T:(lIf) to each x E lIf. A map which
assigns to each x E lJl an element of T:(lJl) will be called a covector field or a
linear differential form. The linear differential form determined by the function f
will be denoted simply by df.
Let W be a linear differential form. Thus w(x) E T:(lJl) for each x E lJI.
Let <X be an atlas of lIf. For each (U, a) E lJl we obtain the V*-valued function
w'" on a(U) defined by
for

v E a(U).

(7.3)

If (W, (3) E <X, then (7.2) says that

Wfj({3o a-lev)) = (J",orl({3o a-l(v))*w",(v)

= (Jfjo",-l(V))-l*W",(V)

for

v E a(U n W).

(7.4)

As before, Eq. (7.4) shows that it makes sense to require that W be smooth.
We say that W is a Ck-differential form if w'" is a V*-valued Ck-function for every
chart (U, a). By (7.4) it suffices to check this for all charts in an atlas. Also, if
we are given V*-valued functions w"" each defined on a(U), (U, a) E <X, and
satisfying (7.4), then they define a linear differential form W on M via (7.3).
If W is a differential form and f is a function, we define the form fw by
fw(x) = f(x)w(x). Similarly, we define WI
W2 by

+

(WI

+ W2)(X)

=

Wl(X)

+ W2(X).

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

Let M 1 and M 2 be differentiable manifolds, and let "': M 1 - ? M 2 be a
differentiable map. For any x EM 1 we have the map "'*x: Tx(M 1) - ? T 'Pex)(M 2)'
It therefore defines a dual map
("'u)*: T:ex/M2)

-?

T: (M1)'

(The reader can check that if l E T;Cx)(M 2), then ~ - ? (",*(0, l) is a continuous
linear function of ~, by verification in terms of a chart.)
N ow let w be a differential form on M 2. It assigns w (",(x») E T;cx) (M 2) to
",(x), and thus assigns an element ("'*x)*(w(",(x»)) E Ti(M 1) to x E M 1. We
thus "pull back" the form w to obtain a form on M 1 which we shall call ",*w.
Thus
(7.f»

Note that ",* is defined for any differentiable map as in the case of functions, not only for diffeomorphisms (and in contrast to the situation for vector
fields).
It is easy to give the expression for ",* in terms of compatible charts (U, 0')
of M 1 and (W, (3) of M 2. In fact, from the local expression for ",* we see that,
v E O'(U).

(7.6)

From (7.6) we see that ",*w is smooth if w is. It is clear that ",* preserves algebraie
operations:
(7.7)

",*(fw) = ",*(fJ",*(w).

Let 1/;: M 1 - ? M 2 be a differentiable map, and let f be a differentiable function on ]1,[2. Then (4.6) and the definition df show that

(7.10)

Let", be a flow on M with infinitesimal generator X, and let w be a smooth
linear differential form on M. Then the form ",iw is locally defined and, as in tIll'
case of functions and vector fields, the limit as t - ? 0 of

exists. We can verify this by using (7.6) and proceeding as we did in the casp
of vector fields. The limit will be a smooth covector field which we shall call
Dxw. We could give an expression for Dxw in terms of a chart, just as w('
did for vector fields.

For the remainder of this chapter we shall assume that our manifolds are finitedimensional. Let M be a differentiable manifold whose V = IRn. If (U, a) is a
chart of M, then we define the function x~ on U by setting
x~(x) = ith coordinate of a(x).

If f is any differentiable function on U, then we can write Eq. (2.1) as

9. RIEMANN METRICS

Let M be a finite-dimensional differentiable manifold. A Riemann metric, m,
on M is a rule which assigns a positive definite scalar product ( , )m .., to the
vector space Tz(M) for each x E M. We shall usually drop the subscripts m and
x when they are understood from the context. Thus if m is a Riemann metric
on M, x E M, and ~, ." E T.,(M), we shall write the scalar product of ~ and." as

Note that (9.5) is the answer we would get if we fonnally substituted (8.12) for

In any event, it is clear from (9.5) that if the h,j are all smooth functions
on W, then the (j,j are smooth on U n W. In view of this we shall say that a

9.9

RIEMANN METRICS

399

Riemann metric is smooth if the functions gij given by (9.3) are smooth for any
chart (U, a) belonging to an atlas a of M. Also, if we are given functions
gij = gji defined for each (U, a) E a such that
i) L gij(X) ~i~j > 0 unless ~ = 0 for all x E U,
ii) the transition law (9.5) holds,
then the gij define a Riemann metric on ]1.[. In the following discussion we shall
assume that our Riemann metrics are smooth.
Let if;: M 1 --+ M 2 be a differentiable map, and let m be a Riemann metric
on M 2. For any x EM 1 define ( , )",*(m),x on TxCM1) by

Note that this defines a symmetric bilinear function of ~ and 7]. It is not
necessarily positive definite, however, since it is conceivable that if;*(~) = 0
with ~ ~ O. Thus, in general, (9.6) does not define a Riemann metric on MI.
For certain if; it does.
A differentiable map if;: M 1 --+ M 2 is called an immersion if if;*x is an injection
(i.e., is one-to-one) for all x EM 1.
If if;: M 1 --+ M 2 is an immersion and m is a Riemann metric on M 2, then we
define the Riemann metric if;*(m) on M 1 by (9.6).
Let (U, a) and (W, (3) be compatible charts of M1 and M 2, and let

Let us give some examples of these formulas. If M

Let us see what this looks like in terms of polar coordinates in 1R2 and 1R3.

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

In IR 2 if we write
Xl

=

r cos 0,

x 2 = r sin 0,

then
dx l = cos 0 dr - r sin 0 dO,
dx 2 = sin 0 dr
r cos 0 dO,

+

so
(9.7)

Note that (9.7) holds whenever the forms dr and dO are defined, i.e., on all of
1R2 - {O}. (Even though the function 0 is not well defined on all of 1R2 - {O},
the form dO is. In fact, we can write
dO

=

Xl dx 2 - x 2 dx l
(XI)2
(X2)2 .)

+

(9.8)

In 1R3 we introduce
Xl = r cos cp sin 0,
x 2 = r sin cp sin 0,
x 3 = r cos o.

Then
dx l = cos cp sin 0 dr - r sin cp sin 0 dcp
dx 2 = sin cp sin 0 dr
r cos cp sin 0 dcp
dx 3 = cos 0 dr - r sin 0 dO.

Thus

dr 2

+ r cos cp cos 0 dO,
+ r sin cp cos 0 dO,

+ r2 sin 2 0 dcp2 + r2 d0 2•

(9.9)

Again, (9.9) is valid wherever the forms on the right are defined, which this time
means when (X I )2
(X 2)2 ~ O.
Let us consider the map L of the unit sphere 8 2 -+ 1R 3 , which consists of
regarding a point of 8 2 as a point of 1R3. We then get an induced Riemann metric
on 8 2 •
Let us set
dcp = L* dcp,
and
dO = L* dO

+

so the forms dO and dcp are defined on U = 8 2
Then on U we can write (since r = 1 on 8 2 )

-

{<O, 0,1>-, <0,0, -1>-}.
(9.10)

We now return to general considerations. Let M be a differentiable manifold
and let C: I -+ M be a differentiable map, where I is an interval in IRI. Let t
denote the coordinate of the identity chart on l. We shall set

C'(S) = C*

(~) (s),

s E I,

so that C'(s) E TC(B)(M) is the tangent vector to the curve C at s. If (U, a) is
a chart on M and xl, ... ,xn are the coordinate functions of (U, a), then if

When there is no possibility of confusion, we shall omit the 0 C and simply write

Now let m be a Riemann metric on M. Then IIC'(t)11 = (C'(t), C'(t))1/2 is a
continuous function. In fact, in terms of a chart, we can write

V2:: %(C(t)xi'(t)xj'(t) .

IIC'(t)1I =
The integral

[ IIC'(t)11 dt

(9.11)

is called the length ofthe curve C. It will be defined if IIC' (t) II is integrable over I.
This will certainly be the case if I and IIC'(t) II are both bounded, for instance.
Note that the length is independent of the parametrization. More precisely,
let ep: J - t I be a one-to-one differentiable map, and let C I = Co ep. Then at
any r E J we have

that is,

Ci(r) = ; : C'(t).
Thus

On the other hand, by the law for change of variable in an integral we have

by

(9.12).

More generally, we say that a curve C defined on an interval I is piecewise
differentiable if
i) C is continuous;
ii) I = I I U' .. U IT and C, on each Ij, is the restriction of a differentiable
curve defined on some interval Ij strictly containing Ii'

402

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

(Thus a piecewise differentiable curve is a curve with a finite number of "corners".) If C is piecewise differentiable, then IIC'(t) II is defined and continuous
except at a finite number of t's, where it may have a jump discontinuity. In
particular, the integral (9.11) will exist and the curve will have a length.
Exercise. Let C be a curve mapping I onto a straight line segment in IRn in a one-toone manner. Show that the length of C is the same as the length of the segment.

Let C: [0, 1] ~ 1R2 be a curve with C(O) = 0 and C(I) = v E 1R2. If we use
the expression (9.7), we see that

IIIC'(t) II dt = IvI(r'(t))2

r'(t) dt

with equality holding if and only if 0' 0 and r' ~ O. Thus among all curves
joining to v, the straight line segment has shortest length.
Similarly, on the sphere, let C be any curve C: [0, 1] ~ 8 2 with C(O) =
(0,0, 1) and C(I) = p -:;6- (0,0, -1), and let 01 = O(C(I) ). Then

IIIC'(t)11 dt =

I

vi (O'(t))2 + sin 2 o(P'(t)) 2 dt

with equality only if <p'
and tl = 1. Thus the shortest curve joining any
two points on 8 2 is the great circle joining them.
In both examples above we were aided by a very fortuitous choice of coordinates (polar coordinates in the plane and a kind of polar coordinates on the
sphere). We shall see in Section 11, Chapter 13, that this is not accidental. We
shall see that on any Riemann manifold one can introduce local coordinates in
terms of which it is easy to describe the curves that locally minimize length.

CHAPTER 10

THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS

In this chapter we shall study integration on manifolds. In order to develop
the integral calculus, we shall have to restrict the class of manifolds under
consideration. In this chapter we shall assume that all manifolds M that arise
satisfy the following two conditions:
1) M is finite-dimensional.
2) M possesses an atlas ex containing (at most) a countable number of
charts; that is, ex = {(U i , (Xi)}i=1,2, ...•

Before getting down to the business of integration, there are several technical
facts to be established. The first two sections will be devoted to this task.
1. COMPACTNESS

A subset A of a manifold 1Jl is said to be compact if it has the following property:
i)

If {U,} is any collection of open sets with
ACUU"

there exist finitely many of the U" say U'I' ... , U", such that
A C U'I U ... U U",

Alternatively, we can say:
ii) A set A is compact if and only if for any family {F,} of closed sets
such that

there exist finitely many of the F, such that
A n F'I n ... n F"

=

0.

The equivalence of (i) and (ii) can be seen by taking U, equal to the complement of F,.
In Section 5 of Chapter 4 we established that if M = U is an open subset of
IRn, then A C U is compact if and only if A is a closed bounded subset of IRn.
403

404

THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS

10.1

We make some further trivial remarks about compactness:
iii) If A b

... ,

AT are compact, so is A 1 U ... U AT'

In fact, if {U,} covers A1 u··· U AT, it certainly covers each A j . We can
thus choose for each j a finite subcollection which covers A j . The union of these
subcollections forms a finite sub collection covering A 1 U ... U AT'
iv) If 1/;: M 1 ---7 M 2 is continuous and A eM 1 is compact, then 1/;[A] is
compact.
In fact, if {U,} covers 1/;[A], then {y;-1(U,)} covers A. If the U, are open,
so are the 1/;-1(U,), since 1/; is continuous. We can thus choose '1, ... , 'T so that

A C 1/;-1(U,J u· .. u 1/;-1 (U,),
which implies that 1/;[A] C U'I U· .. U U'T'
We see from this that if A = A1 u· .. U An where each Aj is contained
in some Wi, where (Wi, f3i) is a chart, and f3i(Aj) is a compact subset of ~n,
then A is compact. In particular, the manifold M itself may be compact. For
instance, we can write sn as the union of the upper and lower hemispheres:
sn = {x: xn+1 ~ O} U {x : xn+1 ~ O}. Each hemisphere is compact. In fact,
the upper hemisphere is mapped onto {y : Ilyll ~ I} by the map IP1 of Section 8.1,
and the lower hemisphere is mapped onto the same set by IP2' Thus the sphere
is compact.
On the other hand, an open subset of ~n is not compact. However, it can
be written as a countable union of compact sets. In fact, if U C ~n is an open
set, let
An = {x E U: IIxll ~ nand p(x, aU) ~ lin}.

It is easy to check that An is compact and that

UAn = U.
In view of condition (2), we can say the same for any manifold M under
consideration:
Proposition 1.1. Any manifold M satisfying (1) and (2) can be written as

where each Ai C 111 is compact.
Proof. In fact, by (2)

and by the preceding discussion each Uj can be written as the countable union
of compact sets. Since the countable union of a countable union is still countable, we obtain Proposition 1.1. 0

10.2

PARTITIONS OF UNITY

405

An immediate corollary is:
Proposition 1.2. Let M be a manifold [satisfying (1) and (2)], and let {U.}
be an open covering of M. Then we can select a countable sub collection
{U j } such that

Proof. Write M = UA" where Ar is compact. For each r we can choose finitely
many Ur,b Ur ,2, ... , Ur,k r so that

Ar C Ur,l u· .. U Ur,kr"

The collection

is a countable subcollection covering M. D
2. PARTITIONS OF UNITY

In the following discussion it will be convenient for us to have a method of
"breaking up" functions, vector fields, etc., into "little pieces". For this purpose
we introduce the following notation:
Definition 2.1. A collection {gj} of COO-functions is said to be a partition of

unity if

i) gi 2:: 0 for all i;
ii) supp git is compact for all i;
iii) each x E M has a neighborhood Vx such that Vx
for all but a finite number of i; and
iv)

L

gi(X)

=

n supp gi = 0

1 for all x E M.

Note that in view of (iii) the sum occurring in (iv) is actually finite, since
for any x all but a finite number of the gi(X) vanish. Note also that:
Proposition 2.1. If A is a compact set and {gj} is a partition of unity, then

An supp gi

= 0

for all but a finite number of i.
Proof. In fact, each x E A has a neighborhood Vx given by (iii). The sets
{V x} xEA form an open covering of A. Since A is compact, we can select a finite
sub collection {V 1, . . . , V r } with A C V 1 U ... U V r. Since each V k has a

nonempty intersection with only finitely many of the supp
union, and so a fortiori does A. D

THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS

3. DENSITIES

If we regard IR n as a differentiable manifold, then the law for change of variables

for an integral shows that the integrand does not have the same transition law
as that of a function under change of chart. For this reason we cannot expect
to integrate functions on a manifold. We now introduce the type of object that
we can integrate.
Definition 3.1. A density P is a rule which assigns to each chart (U, a) of
M a function Pa defined on a(U) subject to the following transition law:
If (W, (3) is a second chart of M, then

for v E a(U n W).

(3.1)

If a is an atlas of M and functions Pa, are given for all (U i , ai) E a satisfying
(3.1), then the Pa, define a density P on M. In fact, if (U, a) is any chart of M
(not necessarily belonging to a), define Pa by

This definition is consistent:
Pa;(aj

0

If v E a(U

n U i) n a(U n Uj),

then by (3.1),

Pa;(ai

a-I (v)) Idet Ja,oa-l(v)1

a-I (v) ) IIdet J a;oa- I (v) I

by the chain rule and the multiplicative property of determinants.
In view of (3.1) it makes sense to talk about local smoothness properties of
densities. We will say that a density P is Ck if for any chart (U, a) the function
Pa is Ck • As usual, it suffices to verify this for all charts (U, a) belonging to some
atlas. Similarly, we say that a density P is locally absolutely integrable if for
any chart (U, a) the function Pa is absolutely integrable. By the last proposition
of Chapter 8 this is again independent of the choice of atlases.
Let P be a density on M, and let x be a point of M. It does not make sense
to talk about the value of pat x. However, (3.1) shows that it does make sense
to talk about the sign of P at x, More precisely, we say that
P

>

0 at x

if Pa(a(x))

>

0

(3.2)

f~r a chart (U, a) about x. Equation (3.1) shows that if Pa(a(x)) > 0, then
P/3({3(x)) > 0 for any other chart (W, (3) about x. Similarly, it makes sense to
say that P < 0 at x, P > 0 at x, or P ~ 0 at x.
Definition 3.2. Let P be a density on M. By the support of P, denoted by
supp P, we shall mean the closure of the set of points of M at which P does
not vanish. That is,
supp P = {x: P ~ 0 at x}.

10.3

DENSITIES

409

Let Pl and P2 be densities. We define their sum by setting
(Pl

+ P2)a =

Pla

+ P2a

(3.3)

for any chart (U, ex). It is immediate that the right-hand side of (3.3) satisfies
the transition law (3.1), and so defines density on M.
Let P be a density, and let f be a function. We define the density fp by
(3.4)

Again, the verification of (3.1) is immediate in view of the transition laws for
functions.
It is clear that
(3.5)
supp (Pl
P2) C supp Pl U supp P2
and
(3.6)
supp (fp) = suppf n supp p.
We shall write
if P2 - Pl 2: 0 at x
Pl ::; P2 at x
and
if Pl::; P2 at all x E M.
Pl ::; P2

+

Let P denote the space of locally absolutely integrable densities of compact
support. We observe that P is a vector space and that the product fp belongs
to P if f is a (bounded) locally contented function and pEP.
TheoreIn 3.1. There exists a unique linear function f on P satisfying the
following condition: If pEP is such that supp pC U, where (U, ex) is a
chart of M, then
(3.7)
p = (
Pa.

Proof. We first show that there is at most one linear function satisfying (3.7).
Let a be an atlas of M, and let {gj} be a partition of unity subordinate to a.
For each} choose an iU) so that
supp gj C

Ui(j).

Write P = 1· P = L gj' p. Since supp P is compact, only finitely many
of the terms gjp are not identically zero. Thus the sum is finite. Since f is linear,

By (3.7),

we must show that (3.8) defines a linear function on P satisfying (3.7). The
linearity is obvious; we must verify (3.7).
Suppose supp pC U for some chart (U, a). We must show that

We can derive a number of useful properties of the integral from the formula (3.8):
(3.10)
In fact, since (lj 2:: 0, we have «(ljPl)", :::; «(ljP2)", for any chart (U, a).
Thus (3.10) follows from the corresponding fact on IR n if we use (3.8).
Let us say that a set A has content zero if A C A I U ... U Ap where each
Ai is compact, A, C U i for some chart (U i , ai), and ai(A,) has content zero ill
IRn. It is easy to see that the union of any finite number of sets of content zero
has content zero. It is also clear that the function eA is contented.
Let us call a set B C J1[ contented if the function eB is contented. For any
pEP we define
P by
(3.11)

IB

It follows from (3.8) that

Lp=O

for any pEP if A has content zero. We can thus ignore sets of content zero for
the purpose of integration. In practice, one usually takes advantage of this when
computing integrals, rather than using (3.8). For instance, in computing an
integral over sn, we can "ignore" any meridian: for example, if
A = {x E sn : x = (t, 0, ... , ±yr=t2) E IR n + I },
then
for any p.

Isn

This means that we can compute
P by introducing polar coordinates
(Fig. 10.1) and expressing P in terms of them. Thus in S2, if U = S2 - A and
a is the polar coordinate chart on U, then

It is worth observing that if N is a differentiable manifold of dimension less
than dim M and if; is a differentiable map of N ~ M, then Proposition 7.3 of
Chapter 8 implies that if A is any compact subset of N, then if;(A) has content
zero in M. In this sense, one can ignore "lower-dimensional sets" when integrating on M.

It is easy to see that (4.1) actually defines a density. Let (W, fJ) be a second

If M is an open subset of Euclidean space with the Euclidean metric, then
the volume density, when integrated over any contented set, yields the ordinary
Euclidean volume of that set. In fact, if x I, . . . , Xn are orthonormal coordinates
corresponding to the identity chart, then gij(X) = 0 if i ~ j and gii = 1, so
that Uid == 1 and thus

L = L1 = }L(A).

More generally, let 'P be an immersion of a k-dimensional manifold Minto
IR n such that 'P(M) is an open subset of a k-dimensional hyperplane in IR n, and
let m be the Riemann metric induced on M by 'P. Then, if U denotes the corre-

sponding volume density, fA U is the k-dimensional Euclidean volume of 'P(A).
In fact, by a Euclidean motion, we may assume that 'P maps M into IRk C IRn.
Then, since 'P is an immersion and M is k-dimensional, we can use x I, . . . , Xk
as coordinates on M and conclude, as before, that U is given by the function in
terms of these coordinates, and hence that fA U = }L('P(A).
Now let 'PI and 'P2 be two immersions of M ~ IRn. Let (U, a) be a coordinate
chart on M with coordinates y\ ... ,yk. If mI is the Riemann metric induced
by 'Pi, then

RO}1ghly speaking, this means that if CPt and CP2 are close, in the sense that their
derivatives are close, then the densities they induce are close.
We apply this remark to the following situation. We let CPt be an immersion
qf Minto IR" and let (W, a) be some chart of M with coordinates yt, ••• , yk.
We let U = W - C = UUz, where C is some closed set of content zero and
such that Uz n Uz' = 9J if Z ¢ l'. For each Z let be a point of Ui whose
coordinates are -< yl, ••• , y~ > , and for z = -< y t, . . . , yk> define CP2 by setting,

THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS

If the Uz's are sufficiently small, then

II:~~ - ~~!II
will be small. More generally, we could choose CP2 to be any affine linear map
approximating CPl on each U z• We thus see that the volume of W in terms of the
Riemann metric induced by cP is the limit of the (suljace) volume of polyhedra
approximating cp(W). Here the approximation must be in the sense of slope
(Le., the derivatives must be close) and not merely in the sense of position.
The construction of the volume density can be generalized and suggests an
alternative definition of the notion of density. In fact, let P be a rule which
assigns to each x in M a function, Px, on n tangent vectors in Tx(M) subject to
the rule
(4.2)
where ~i E Tx(M) and A: Tx(M) ~ Tx(M) is a linear transformation. Then
we see that P determines a density by setting
Pa(a(x))

=

P

(a~l (x), ... 'a~n (X))

(4.3)

if (U, a) is a chart with coordinates uI, ... ,un. The fact that (4.3) defines a
density follows immediately from (4.2) and the transformation law for the
a/au i under change of coordinates.
Conversely, given a density P in terms of the Pa, define p(a/auI, ... , a/au n)
by (4.3). Since the vectors {a/aUi}i=l, ... ,n form a basis at each x in U, any
6, ... , ~n in Tx(M) can be written as

a

~i=B-a. (x),

u'

where B is a linear transformation of Tx(M) into itself. Then (4.2) determines
p(6, ... , ~n) as
(4.4)
p(6, ... , ~n) = Idet BIPa(a(x)).
That this definition is consistent (i.e., doesn't depend on a) follows from (4.2)
and the transformation law (3.1) for densities.

for ~i E Tx(M 1) and cp* = Cp*x. To show that cp*p is actually a density, we must

Let (U, a) and (W, (3) be compatible charts on M 1 and M 2 with coordinates

Proof. It suffices to prove (5.3) for the case

for some chart (U, a) of M 1 with cp(U) C W, where (W, (3) is a chart of M 2.
In fact, the set of all such cp( U) is an open covering of J],f 2, and we can therefore
choose a partition of unity {gj} subordinate to it. If we write P = L gjP, then
the sum is finite and each gjp has the observed property. Since both sides of (5.3)
are linear, we conclude that it suffices to prove (5.3) for each term.

that each of the functions aij(t) is differentiable. We can therefore find a constant
K such that lai/t)1 :::;; Kltl (i ~ j) and laii(t) - 11 : :; Kltl. In the expansion of
det A(t), the only term which will not vanish at least as t 2 is the diagonal product
all(t)··· ann(t). In fact, any other term in L ± ali 1 (t)··· aniJt) involves at

6. THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM

Let <P be a flow on a differentiable manifold M with infinitesimal generator X.
Let p be a density belonging to P, and let A be a contented subset of M. Then
for small values of t, we would expect the difference f"'t(Al P - fA P to depend
only on what is happening near the boundary of A (Fig. lOA). In the limit,
we would expect the derivative of f<P,cAl p at t = 0 (which is given by
fA div <X, p» to be given by some integral over aA. In order to formulate
such a result, we must first single out a class of sets whose boundaries are sufficiently nice to allow us to integrate over them. We therefore make the following
definition:
Definition. Let M be a differentiable manifold, and let D be a subset of M.
We say that D is a domain with regular boundary if for every x E M there is a

chart (U, ex) about x, with coordinates x!, ... ,x:, such that one of the
following three possibilities holds:
i) Un D = 50;
ii) U c D;
iii) cx(U n D) = exCU) n {v = <Vi, ... I vn > E IRn : V n ~ O}.

420

10.6

THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS

Note that if x G!: TI, we can always find a (U, a) about x such that (i) holds.
If x E int D, we can always find a chart (U, a) about x such that (ii) holds.
This imposes no restrictions on D. The crucial condition is imposed when
x E aD. Then we cannot find charts about x satisfying (i) or (ii). In this case,
(iii) implies that a(U n aD) is an open subset of IRn-1 (Fig. 10.5). In fact,
a(U n aD) = {v E a(U) : v n = O} = a(U) n IRn-l, where we regard IR n- 1 as
the subspace of IRn consisting of those vectors with last component zero.

a(UnaD)

Fig. 10.5

Let a be an atlas of M such that each chart of a satisfies either (i), (ii), or
(iii). For each (U, a) E a consider the map a aD: U n aD ~ IR n- 1 C IRn.
[Of course, the maps a aD will have a nonempty domain uf definition only for
charts of type (iii).] We claim that {(U n aD, a I aD)} is an atlas on aD. In
fact, let (U, a) and (W, (3) be two charts in a such that C n lV n aD ~ [25.
Let Xl, . . . ,x n be the coordinates of (U, a), and let yl, . . . ,yn be those of
(W, (3). The map f3 0 a-I is given by

On a(U

= 0 and yn = O. In particular,

== 0,

and the functions yl(xl, ... , xn-l, 0), ... ,
yn-l (xl, ... , xn-l, 0) are differentiable. This
])
shows that (f3 I aD) 0 (a aD)-1 is differentiable on a(U n aD). We thus get a manifold x
structure on aD.
I t is easy to see that this manifold structure is independent of the particular atlas of !If
that was chosen. We shall denote by L the map
of aD ~ M which sends each x E aD, regarded
Fig. 10.6
as an element of M, into itself. It is clear that
L is a differentiable map. (In fact, (U n aD, a
aD) and (U, a) are compatible
charts in terms of which a 0 , 0 (a I aD)-1 is just the map of IRn-1 ~ IRn.)
Let x be a point of aD regarded as a point of M, and let t be an element
of Tx(M). We say that t points into D if for every curve C with C'(O) = t.
we have C(t) E D for sufficiently small positive t (Fig. 10.6). In

Proof. Let a be an atlas of M each of whose charts is one of the three types.
Let {Yi} be a partition of unity subordinate to a. Write P = L YiP. This is a

finite sum. Since both sides of (6.3) are linear functions of P it suffices to verify
(6.3) for each of the summands YiP. Changing our notation (replacing YiP by p),
we reduce the problem to proving (6.3) under the additional assumption
supp pC U, where (U, a) is a chart of type (i), (ii), or (iii). There are therefore
three cases to consider.
CASE I. supp P C U and Un 15 = ¢.
(6.3) vanish, and so (6.3) is correct.

(See Fig. 10.7.) Then both sides of

CASE II. supp pC U with U C int D. (See Fig. 10.8.) Then the right-hand
side of (6.3) vanishes. We must show that the left-hand side does also. But

its domain of definition to all of ~n by setting it equal to zero outside a(U).

If we compare this with (6.2) and (6.4), we see that this is exactly the assertion of

If the manifold M is given a Riemann metric, then we can give an alternative
version of the divergence theorem. Let dV be the volume density of the Riemann
metric, so that

dV(h, ... , ~n)

=

Idet ((~i' ~j»)11/2, ~i

E Tx(M),

is the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the ~i in the tangent space (with
respect to the Euclidean metric given by the scalar product on the tangent space).
Now the map L is an immersion, and therefore we get an induced Riemann
metric on aD. Let dS be the corresponding volume density on aD. Thus, if
{Mi=l, ... ,n-l are n - 1 vectors in Tx(aD), dS(~b ... , ~n-l) is the (n - 1)dimensional volume of the parallelepiped spanned by L*~l"'" L*~n-l in
L*Tx(aD) c Tx(M). For any x E aD let n E Tx(M) be the vector of unit length
which is orthogonal to L*Tx(aD) and which points out of D (Fig. 10.12). We

clearly have
dS(h, ... , ~n-I)

=

dV(L*h, ... , L*~n-b n).

For any vector X(x) E TxCM) (Fig. 10.13) the volume of the parallelepiped
spanned by h, ... , ~n-I, X(x) is I(X(x), n) IdS(~1i ... '~n-I)' [In fact, write

7. MORE COMPLICATED DOMAINS

For many purposes, Theorem 6.1 is not quite sufficiently broad. The trouble is
that we would like to apply (6.3) to domains whose boundaries are not completely smooth. For instance, we would like to apply it to a rectangle in [Rn.
N ow the boundary of a rectangle is regular at all points except those lying on an
edge (i.e., the intersection of two faces). Since the edges form a set "of dimension
n - 2", we would expect that their presence does not invalidate (6.3). This is
in fact the case.
Let M be a differentiable manifold, and let D be a subset of M. We say
that D is a domain with almost regular boundary if to every x E M there is a
chart (U, a) about x, with coordinates xl, ... ,x~, such that one of the following
four possibilities holds:
i)

Un D

= 0;

ii) UeD;

E [Rn :

The novel point is that we are now allowing for possibility (iv) where k < n.
This, of course, is a new possibility only if n > 1. Let us assume n > 1 and see
what (iv) allows. We can write a(U n aD) as the union of certain open subsets
lying in (n - I)-dimensional subspaces of [Rn-I, together with a union of
portions lying in subspaces of dimension n - 2.

Thus H~ is an open subset of the (n - I)-dimensional subspace given by

We next observe the set of x E aD having a neighborhood of type (iii) forms
a differentiable manifold. The argument is just as before. The only difference
is that this time these points do not exhaust all of aD. We shall denote this
manifold by lib. Thus lib is a manifold which, as a set, is not aD but only the
"regular" points of aD, that is, those having charts of type (iii).
Theorem 7.1 (The divergence theorem).

Let M be an n-dimensional
manifold, and let D C M be a domain with almost regular boundary.

Proof. The proof proceeds as before. We choose a connecting atlas of charts
of types (i) through (iv) and a partition of unity {gj} subordinate to the atlas.
We write P = L gjp and now have four cases to consider. The first three cases
have already been handled.
The new case arises when p has its support in U, where (U, a) is a chart of
type (iv). We must evaluate

The terms in the sum corresponding to i < k make no contribution to the
integral, as before. Let us extend XiPa to be defined on all of ~n by setting it
equal to zero outside a(U), just as before. Then, for k :::; i :::; n we have

Note that Ai differs from HZ by a set of content zero in ~n-I (namely, where at
least one of the vl = 0 for k = l :::; n). Thus we can replace the Ai by the H~
in the integral. Summing over k :::; i :::; n, we get

which is exactly the assertion of Theorem 7.1 for case (iv). 0

Fig. 10.18

We should point out that even Theorem 7.1 does not cover all cases for which
it is useful to have a divergence theorem. For instance, in the plane, Theorem 7.1
does apply to the case where D is a triangle. (See Fig. 10.16.) This is because
we can "stretch" each angle to a right angle (in fact, we can do this by a linear
change of variables of ~2). (See Fig. 10.17.)
However Theorem 7.1 does not apply to a quadrilateral such as the one in
Fig. 10.18, since there is no CI-transformation that will convert an angle greater
than 7r into one smaller than 7r (since its Jacobian at the corner must carry
lines into lines). Thus Theorem 7.1 doesn't apply directly. However, we can
write the quadrilateral as the union of two triangles, apply Theorem 7.1 to each
triangle, and note that the contributions of each triangle coming from the
common boundary cancel each other out. Thus the divergence theorem does
apply to our quadrilateral.
This procedure works in a quite general context. In fact, it works for all
cases where we shall need the divergence theorem in this book, whether Theorem
7.1 applies directly or we can reduce to it by a finite subdivision of our domain,
followed by a limiting argument. We shall not, however, fornmlate a general
theorem covering all such cases; it is clear in each instance how to proceed.

Let M be a differentiable manifold and let W be a linear differential form in ilf.
For any differentiable curve C: [a, bl ----i M \ye can consider the integral
(C'(t), wC(t) elt. Let [c, ell ----i [a, bl be a differentiable lllap given by s ----i t(s).
The curve B: [c, ell ----i M given by B(s) = C(t(s)) satisfies

Thus a linear differential form is something we can integrate over "oriented"
curves of ]1.1 and is independent of the parametrization. In this chapter ,ye shall
introduce objects \yhich can be integrated over "oriented k-dimensional surfaces"
of M and study their properties.
1. EXTERIOH DIFFEHENTIAL FOHMS

We defined a linear differential form to be a rule which assigns an element of
T;(M) to each x E M. We can regard T;(M) as a 1 (Tx(M)). In view of this,
we make the following generalization of this definition. By an exterior differential form of degree q on III we mean a rule which assigns an clement of
aq(Tx(M)) to each x E M. If W is an exterior form of degree q and (U, a) is a
chart, then, since a identifies each Tx(il1) with V for x E U, we obtain an
aq (V)-valued function, W,,' on a( U) defined by
if v

=

a(x) and ~1,

... ,

~q E Tx(M).

It is easy to write down the transition laws. In fact, if (W, (3) is a second
chart, we have
WiJ((3(x))(~J, ... , ~~) = w(X)(~l, ... , ~q) = w,,(a(x))(~;, ... , ~:D

or, since ~iJ

=

JiJo,,-l(a(x))(~,,) for ~ E Tx(I1f), we see that

w,,(v)(~;, ... , ~~) = WiJ((3

0

a- 1(v)) (JiJo,,-l(vH~, ... ,JiJo,,-l(vH':x).

(1.1)

In order to write (1.1) in a less cumbersome form, we introduce the following
notation. Let V 1 and V 2 be vector spaces, and let l: V 1 ---7 V 2 be a linear map.
429

430

11.1

EXTERIOR CALCULUS

We define (iP(l) to be the linear map of (iP(Y 2)

-7

(iP(V I) given by

(iP(l)(w)(vr, . .. , vp) = w(l(vI), ... ,1(vp))

for all 10 E (iP(V 2) and VI, ... ,Vp E VI. Note that under the identification of
(i I (V) with V* the map (i I (l) coincides with the map 1*:
- 7 V~. Note also
that if WI Eo (iP(V 2) and 102 E (iq(v 2), then

V;

(iP(l)n' l 1\ (iQ(l)U'2 = (ip+q(l)(wl 1\ W2)'

This follows directly from the definitions. Also, if / 1 : V I
then

-7

(1.2)

V 2 and 12 : V 2

-7

V 3,

(1.3)
It is clear that if 1 depends differentiably on some parameters, then so does
(iP(l) for any p.
We can now write (1.1) as

(1.1')
It is clear from (1.1') that it is consistent to require that w" be a smooth
function. We therefore say that W is a smooth differential form if all the functions
w" are C'" on O'.(U) for all charts (U, 0'.). As usual, it suffices to verify this for all
charts in an atlas. We let /\ q(l'tJ) denote the space of all smooth exterior forms
of degree q.
Let WI E /\P(M) and W2 E /\q(M). We define the exterior (p
q)-form
WI 1\ W2 by
for all x E l'tJ.

+

+

It is easy to check that WI 1\ W2 is a smooth (p
q)-form. We thus get a multiplication on exterior forms. To make the formalism complete, it is convenient
to denote the space of differentiable functions on l'tJ by /\ O(]I.f) and to denote
the product of a function f and a p-form W by fw or f 1\ w. This product is
given by
for all x E M.
(f 1\ w)(x) = (fw)(x) = f(x)w(x)

We have thus defined, for all 0 ~ p ~ nand 0 ~ q ~ 11, a multiplication
sending WI E /\P(M) and W2 E /\q(M) into WI 1\ W2 E /\p+q(M) (where
WI 1\ W2 == 0 if p + q > n = dim M). The rules for the 1\ -product on antisymmetric tensors carryover and thus, for instance,
WI 1\ (W2 1\ W2) = (WI 1\ W2) 1\ W3,
WI 1\ (W2

+ W3)

= WI 1\ W2

+ WI

1\ W3,

and so OIl.
Let M I and M 2 be differentiable manifolds, and let cp: M I - 7 M 2 be a
differentiable map. For each W E / \ q (M 2) we define the form cp*w E /\q(M I) by
cp*w(x) = (iq (cp*x)(

we cp(x)) ).

(1.4)

11.1

EXTERIOR DIFFERENTIAL FORMS

431

It is easy to check that cp*w is indeed an element of /\ q(M 1), that is, it is a
smooth q-form. Note also that (7.5) of Chapter 9 is a special case of (l.4)-the
case q = 1. (If we make the convention that a°(l) = id, then the case q = 0
of (1.4) is the rule for pullback of functions.)
It follows from (1.4) that cp* is linear, that is,

(1.5)
and from (1.2) that
(1.6)
If cp is a one-parameter group on a manifold M with infinitesimal generator
X, then we can show that the

exists for any W E /\ q(M). The proof of the existence of this limit is straightforward and will be omitted. We shall derive a useful formula allowing a simple
calculation of Dxw in Section 3.
Let us now see how to compute with the /\ q(M) in terms of local coordinates.
Let (U, a) be a chart of M with coordinates xI, .. . , xn. Then dx i E /\1(U)
(where by /\ q(U) we mean the set of differentiable q-forms defined on U).
For any it, ... , i q the form dX il 1\ ... 1\ dx iq belongs to /\q(U), and for every
x E U the forms
{(dX il 1\ ... 1\ dxiq)(X)}i1<"'<iq
form a basis for aq(Tx(M). From this it follows that every exterior form
of degree q which is defined on U can be written as

w

(1.7)

w=

where the a's are functions; that is,
w(x)

L:

=

ai1 ..... iq(X)(dx il 1\ ... 1\ dxiq)(x)

i1<···<i.

for all x E U. It is easy to see that wE /\q(U) if and only if all the functions ai1 ..... iq are COO-functions on U.
If (W, (3) is a second chart with coordinates y1, ... , yn and
w

then it is easy to compute the transition law relating the b's to the a's on U
In fact, on Un W we have

(1.9)

where yi = yi(xI, ... ,xn). Then all we have to do is to substitute (1.9) into
(1.8) and collect the coefficients of dX il 1\ ... 1\ dxio. For instance, if q = 2,

The formula for pullback takes exactly the same form. Let <p: lJJ! ---7 )1,f c

Again, we emphasize that there is no need to remember a complicated
looking formula like (1.14); Eqs. (1.5), (1.6), and (1.12) (and of course the rules
for 1\ -multiplication) are sufficient. In many cases, it is much more convenient
to do the substitutions directly than to use (1.14).
2. ORIENTED MANIFOLDS AND
THE INTEGRATION OF EXTERIOR DIFFERENTIAL FORMS

Let lvI be an n-dimensional manifold. Let (U, a) and (W, (3) be two charts on lvI
with coordinates xl, ... , xn and yl, ... ,yn. Let w be an exterior differential
form of degree n. Then we can write
on

U

and
w = b dyl 1\ ... 1\ dyn

on W,

where the functions a and b are related on U n W by (1.11), which, in this case
(q = n), becomes

or
or, finally,
aa(v)

= bfj ({3

a-I (v) )

det J fjoa-l(v)

for v E a(U n W).

(2.1)

If P is a density on lvI, then the transition laws for Pa are given by

Pa(v)

=

Pfj({3

0

a-1(v))ldet Jfjoa-l(v)l.

(2.2)

Note that (2.2) and (2.1) look almost the same; the difference is the absolutevalue sign that occurs in (2.2) but not in (2.1). In particular, if (U, a) and
(W, (3) were such that det J fjoa-l > 0, then (2.2) and (2.1) would agree for this
pair of charts.

434

11.2

EXTERIOR CALCULUS

This leads us to the following definition: An atlas a of M is said to be
oriented if for any pair of charts (U, a) and (W, (3) of a we have
detJj3o",-l(a(x))

>

0

for all

x E U n W.

There is no guarantee that there exists an oriented atlas on a given manifold M.
In fact, it is not difficult to show that there does not exist an oriented atlas on
certain manifolds. (An example of a manifold possessing no oriented atlas is
the Mobius strip.)
We say that a manifold M is orientable if it has an oriented atlas.
Let M be an orientable manifold, and let a l and a 2 be two oriented atlases.
We say that a l and a 2 have the same orientation, and write al 0' a 2 , if a l U a 2
is again an oriented atlas. To say that a l 0' a 2 meabs that for any (U, a) E a l
and any (W, (3) E a 2 we have
det Jj3o",-l(V)

>

0

on

a(U

n W).

It is clear that 0' is an equivalence relation. An equivalence class of oriented
atlases is called an orientation of M. An orientable manifold, together with a
choice of orientation, will be called an oriented manifold. We shall denote an
oriented manifold by M. That is, M is a manifold M together with a choice
of orientation. Thus an oriented one-dimensional manifold has a preferred
direction at each point (Fig. 11.1); an oriented two-dimensional manifold has a
notion of clockwise versus counterclockwise direction (Fig. 11.2); and at any
point of an oriented three-dimensional manifold we can distinguish between
right- and left-handedness.

Fig. 11.1

Fig. 11.2

In general, let M be an oriented manifold, and let (U, a) be a chart of M
with coordinates xl, ... ,xn. We say that (U, a) is a positive chart if Jj3o",-l > 0
for any chart (W, (3) belongi~g to any oriented atlas defining (i.e., belonging to)
the orientation. (It suffices to check this, of course, for all (W, (3) belonging to
one fixed atlas defining the orientation.) Note that if U is connected, then if
(U, a) is not positive, then the chart (U, a l ), where

is a positive chart.
We shall say that (U, a) is a negative chart if det J j3o",-l < 0 for all (W, (3)
belonging to an atlas defining the orientation. (Thus, if U is connected, thell
(U, a) must be either positive or negative.)

11.2

THE INTEGRATION OF EXTERIOR DIFFERENTIAL FORMS

435

We now return to our initial observation comparing (2.1) with (2.2).
Proposition 2.1. Let l\1 be an oriented n-dimensional manifold.

We can
identify exterior forms of degree n with densities by sending the form w
into the density pW, where for any positive chart (U, a) with coordinates
Xl, . . . , x n , the function
is determined by

p:

w = p:(a(.)) dx l 1\ ... 1\ dxn

on

U.

(2.3)

Another way of writing (2.3) is

w(a/ax l ,

.•. ,

a/ax n) = p(a/ax l ,

..• ,

a/axn).

(2.3')

In other words, if w = a clx l 1\ ... 1\ clx" on U, then p~(v) = aa. That pW
is really a density follows from the fact that (2.2) reduces to (2.1) for all pairs
of charts belonging to a positive atlas.
It is clear that this identification is additive,
(2.4)

and that for any fUllction,
(2.5)

Furthermore, if w(x) = 0, then pW = 0 at x. By the support of a differential
form we mean, as usual, the closure of the set of x for which w(x) ~ O. We say
that an n-form w is locally absolutely integrable if the density pW is locally
absolutely integrable. Note that to say that w is locally absolutely integrable
means that for any chart (U, a), with coordinates Xl, . . . ,x n of some atlas ex, if

w

=

a dx l 1\ ... 1\ clxn

on

U,

then the function aa = a 0 a- l is an absolutely integrable function on a(U).
Let r(M) denote the space of absolutely integrable n-forms of compact support.
It is clear that r(M) is a vector space and that fw E r(M) if f is a (bounded)
contented function and wE r(M). As a consequence of Proposition 2.1 and
Theorem 3.1 of Chapter 10, we can state:
Theorem 2.1. Let M be an oriented manifold. There exists a unique linear

function f on r(M) satisfying the following condition: If supp w C U,
where (U, a) is a positive chart with coordinates xl, ... , x n , and if w =
a dx l 1\ ... 1\ clx n, then

J=1
w

a(U)

aa·

(2.6)

Observe that we can write
for all

wE r(M).

(2.7)

The recipe for computing f w is now very simple. We break w up into small
pieces such that each piece lies in some U. (We can ignore sets of content zero

436

11.2

EXTERIOR CALCULUS

in the process.) If supp w C U, and if (U, a) is a positive chart, we express w as
w

= a dx 1

/\ ••• /\

dxn.

And if a is given as a = aa(xI, ... , x n), we integrate the function aa over IRn.
The computations are automatic. Thus one point that has to be checked is that
the chart (U, a) is positive. If it is negative, then f w is given by - faa.
Let M1 be an oriented manifold of dimension q, let cp: M1 ---t M2 be a
differentiable map, and let w E Aq(M 2 ). Then for any contented compact set
A C M1 the form eACP*(w) belongs to r(M 1), so we can consider its integral.
This integral is sometimes denoted by fcp(A) w; that is, we make the definition
(2.8)
If we regard cp(A) as an "oriented q-dimensional surface" in M 2, then we see
that the elements of A q(M 2) are objects that we can integrate over such
"surfaces". (Of course, if q = 1, we say "curves".)

Let us illustrate by some examples. Suppose that M 2 = IR n , and let A C IR 1
be the interval a :::; t :::; b. Let xl, ... , xn be the coordinates of IR n, and let
w = a 1dx 1 + ... + andxn. We regard 1R1 as an oriented manifold on which
the identity chart is positive (and its coordinate is t). If C: IR 1 ---t IRn is a differentiable curve (Fig. 11.3), then

(2.9)

From this last expression we see that C does not have to be differentiable everywhere in order for fC([a,b]) w to make sense. In fact, if C is differentiable
everywhere on IR except at a finite number of points, and if C'(t) is always
bounded (when regarded as an element of IRn), then the function (C'(·), w) is
defined everywhere except for a set of content zero and is bounded. Thus

11.2

THE INTEGRATION OF EXTERIOR DIFFERENTIAL FORMS

437

C*(w) is a contented density and (2.9) still makes sense. Now the curve can
have corners. (See Fig. 11.4.)
It should be observed that if w = df (and if C is continuous), then

(2.10)

In this case the integral depends not on the particular curve C but on the endpoints. In general,
w depends on the curve C. We will obtain conditions for
it to be independent of C in Section 5.
In the next example let M 2 = 1R3 and M I = U C 1R2 where (u, v) are
Euclidean coordinates on 1R2 and x, y, z are Euclidean coordinates on 1R3. Let

'We conclude this section with another look at the volume density of Riemann
metrics, this time for an oriented manifold. If M is an oriented manifold with a

Now wl(x), ... , wn(x) can be any orthonormal basis of T:(M). [T:(M) has a

3. THE OPERATOR d

With every function f we have associated a linear differential form df. We can
thus regard d as a map from /\ o(M) to /\ I (l\f). As such, it is linear and satisfies
d(fd2) = f2 dfl

+ fl diz.

We now seek to define a cl: /\k(M) ~ /\k+I(.ilf) for k > 0 as well. We shall
require that d be linear and satisfy some identity with regard to multiplication,
generalizing the above formula for cl(fd2)' The condition we will impose is that
cl(WI 1\ W2) = clWI 1\ W2

+ (-l)PwI

1\ clW2

if WI is a form of degree p. The factor (-l)P accounts for the anticommutativity
of 1\. The reader should check that d is consistent with this law, at least to the
extent that d(wl 1\ W2) = (-l)pq cl(W2 1\ WI) if WI is of degree p and W2 is of
degree q.
Weare going to impose one further condition on cl which will uniquely
determine it. This condition (which lies at the heart of the matter) requires

THE OPERATOR d

Fig. 11.5

some introduction. Let f be a differentiable function, and let C: I ~ M be a
differentiable curve. For any points a, bEl, the fundamental theorem of
the calculus implies that
f(C(b)) - f(C(a))

=

lb d(fd~

C) dt

=

lb

C* df.

We can regard b and a (with ± signs attached) as the "oriented boundary"
of the interval [a, b]. Let us make the convention that "integrating" an element
of /\ O(p) is just evaluating the function at the point p. As such, the equation
above says that the integral of the "pullback" of f over the "boundary", that is,
feb) - f(a), equals the integral of the "pullback" of df over [a, b]. In some sense,
we would like to be able to say that if w is a form of degree k, then the integral
of the "pullback" of w over the k-dimensional boundary" of a (k
I)-dimensional region is equal to the integral of the pullback of dw over the (k
1)dimensional region. Without trying to make this requirement precise, let us see
what it says for the case where k = 1 and the region is a triangle in the plane.
Let cP be a smooth map of some neighborhood of the triangle ~ C 1R2 into M,
and let the vertices of ~ be mapped by cp into x, y, and z (see Fig. 11.5). The
boundary of ~ consists of three curves (segments) C b C 2 , and C a (with the
proper orientations). Let w be a linear differential form on M. We would then
expect that

If w = df, then the three integrals on the right become (by the fundamental
theorem of the calculus) fey) - f(x)
fez) - fey)
f(x) - fez) = O. Thus
f cp* d(df) = O. Since the triangle was arbitrary, we expect that

d(df)

O.

We now assert:
Theorelll 3.1. There exists a unique linear map d: /\k(M) ~ /\k+l(M)

such that on

Proof. We first establish the uniqueness of d. To do this we observe that (3.1)
implies that d is local, in the sense that if w = w' on some open set U, thell
dw = dw' on U. In fact, let W be an open set with We U, and let ep be a Coo_
function such that ep(x) == 1 for x E Wand supp ep C U. Then epw = epw' everywhere on ]1.[, and thus dlepw) = d(epw'). But, by (3.1), d(epw) = ep dw
dep /\
w = dw on W, since ep == 1 and dep = 0 there. Thus elw = elw' on W. Since W
can be arbitrary, we conclude that dw = dw' on (T.
Let (U, a) be a chart with coordinates Xl, ••• ,xn. Every wE I\k(M)
can be written as

+

on

w=

U.

Now [by induction on k, using (3.1) and (3.2)] d(elx i1 /\ ... /\ dX ik ) = O.
Thus (3.1) implies that
on

U.

(3.3)

Equation (3.3) gives a local formula for el. It also shows that d is unique. In
fact, we have shown that there is at most one operator d on any open subset
o C 111 mapping 1\k(O) ~ 1\k+1(0) and satisfying the hypotheses of the
theorem (for 0). On the set 0 n U it must be given by (3.3).
We now claim that in order to establish the existence of el, it suffices to show
that the d given by (3.3) [in any chart (U, a)] satisfies the requirement of the
theorem on I\klU). In fact, suppose we have shown this to be so. Let a be
an atlas of 111, and for each chart (U, a) E a define the operator da : I\k(U) ~
1\k+1(U) by (3.3). We would like to set clw = claw on U. For this to be consistent, we must show that claw = dpw on U n W if (W, (3) is some other chart.
But both da and cl p satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem on Un W, and they
must therefore coincide there.
Thus to prove the theorem, it suffices to check that the operator cl, defined
by (3.3), fulfills our requirements as a map of I\k(U) ~ 1\k+1(U). It is obviously linear. To check (3.2), we observe that
af dx i ,

by the equality of mixed partials.
Now we turn to (3.1). Since both sides of (3.1) are linear in WI and W2
separately, it suffices to check (3.1) for WI = a clX i1 /\ ... /\ dx ip and W2 =

so we see that (3.1) holds. This proves the theorem. D
We can draw a number of important corollaries from Eq. (3.3).
First of all, it follows immediately that for W E /\k(M), for any k, we have
d(dw) = O.

(3.4)

(Remember we merely assumed it for k = 0.)
Secondly, let cp: M I -+ M 2 be a differentiable map. Then for W E /\k(M 2)
we have
dcp*w = cp* dw.
(3.5)
To check (3.5), it suffices to verify it for any pair of compatible charts.

4. STOKES' THEOREM

In this section we shall prove a theorem which will be a far-reaching generaliza
tion of the fundamental theorem of the calculus of one variable. It should,
perhaps, be called the fundamental theorem of the calculus of several variables
We first make some definitions.
Let D be a domain with regular boundary in a manifold M. We recall
(page 419) that each point of M lies in a chart (U, a) which is one of three types

11.4

STOKES' THEOHEM

Let (U, a) and (W, (3) be two charts of M of type (iii). Then, as on page 420,

and so

(4.1)
Furthermore, yn(xl, ... ,xn) > 0 if xn > 0, since a(U n W) n {v: vn > O} =
a(U n W n int D). Thus ayn jax n > 0 at a boundary point where Xn = O.
N ow suppose that 1\1 is an oriented manifold, and let D C M be a domain
with regular boundary. We shall make aD into an oriented manifold. We say
that an atlas a is adjusted if each (U, a) E a is of type (i), (ii), or (iii) and, in
addition, if each chart of a is positive.
If dim M > 1, we can always find an adjusted atlas. In fact, by choosing
the U connected, we find that every (U, a) is either positive or negative. If
(U, a) is negative, we replace it by (U, a'), where x~, = -x~.
If dim M = 1, then aD consists of a discrete set of points (which we can
regard as a "zero-dimensional manifold"). Each x E aD lies in a chart of type
(iii) which is either positive or negative. We assign a plus sign to x if any chart
(and hence all constricted charts) of type (iii) is negative. We assign a minus sign
to x if its charts of type (iii) are positive. In this way we "orient" aD, as shown
in Fig . 11.6.
D

+

Fig. 1I.6

If dim M > 1, we choose an adjusted (oriented) atlas on M. It then follows
from (4.1) and the fact that aynjax n > 0 that

det J(fJ ~aD)o(a ~aD)-l

>

O.

This shows that (U f aD, a f aD) is an oriented atlas on aD. We thus get an
orientation on aD. This is not quite the orientation we want on aD. For reasons
that will soon become apparent, we choose the orientation on aD so that

444

11.4

EXTERIOR CALCULUS

(U r aD, a r aD) has the same sign as (_I)n. That is, (U r aD, a r aD) is a
positive chart if n is even, and we take the orientation opposite to that determined by (U r aD, a r aD) if n is odd. We can now state our main theorem.

Theorem 4.1 (Stokes'theorem). Let M be an n-dimensional oriented manifold, and let DC M be a domain with regular boundary. Let aD denote
the boundary of D regarded as an oriented manifold. Then for any
wE !\n-I(M) with compact support we have
(

where, as usual,

L

(4.2)

is the injection of boundary D into M.

Proof. For n = 1 this is just the fundamental theorem of the calculus.
For n > lour proof is almost exactly the same as the proof of Theorem 6.1
of Chapter 10. Choose an adjusted atlas a and a partition of unity {gj} sub-

ordinate to a. Since w has compact support, we can write
W = LgjW,

where the sum is finite. Since both sides of (4.2) are linear, it suffices to verify
(4.2) for each of the summands gJW' Since supp gjW C U, where (U, a), we
must check the three possibilities: (U, a) satisfies (i), (ii), or (iii).
If (U, a) satisfies (i), L*W = 0, since supp W n aD = 0, and

10 dw = 1M eD dw =

0,

since D n supp W = 0. Thus both sides of (4.2) vanish.
If (U, a) satisfies (ii), the left-hand side of (4.2) vanishes. We must show
that the same holds for the right-hand side. Let Xl, .•• ,x n be the coordinates
on (U, a), and write
gjW

+ an

clx 1

+ a2 dx

Then

and thus

Since gjW has compact support, the functions ai have compact support, and
we can replace the integral over ~n by the integral over O!R, where R =
-< R, ... , R> and R is chosen so large that supp ai C O!R' But writing the
multiple integral as an integral, we get

fO'!..R ~~~ =

.£n-l ai( . .. , R, ...) -

since ai( . .. , R, ... ) = ai( . .. , -R, ... ) = 0.

ai( . .. , - R, ... ) = 0,

This completes the proof of the theorem. 0
Theorem 4.1, like the divergence theorem, is not sufficiently broad for us to
apply to more general domams. For this purpose, we will again use the notion
of a domain with almost regular boundary.
We have already seen that the set of x E aD having a neighborhood of type
(iii) forms a differentiable manifold. (Recall that these points need not exhaust
all of aD). Similarly, if M is an oriented manifold, then this collection of points
becomes an oriented manifold (with (-1) n times the induced orientation, as
before). By abuse of language we shall denote this oriented manifold by aD.
Thus aD is an oriented manifold which, as a set, is not aD but only the "regular"
points of aD, that is, the points of ab.

Theorem 4.2 (Stokes' theorem). Let M be an n-dimensional oriented

( L*W =

(4.2)

Proof. The proof proceeds as before. We choose an adjusted atlas and a partition of unity {gj} subordinate to the atlas. We write w = L: gjW and now
have four cases to consider. The first three cases have been handled already.
The new case is where
" aj dx 1 1\ ... 1\ ---gjW = '£oJ
dx'. 1\ ... 1\ dx n,
j

'where the ---- indicates that dx j is to be omitted, has its support contained in U,
where (U, a) is a chart of type (iv). By linearity, it suffices to verify (4.2) for
each summand on the right, i.e., for
aj dx l 1\ .. , 1\ d'7ii 1\ ... 1\ dxn.

Now L*(aj dx l 1\ ... 1\ £j 1\ ... 1\ dx n) = 0 unless j ~ k, since dx P
vanishes on the piece of aD n U whose image under a lies in H;. If j < p,
then all these dx P occur, and thus L*(aj dx l 1\ ... 1\ £j 1\ ... 1\ dx n) = O.
If j > p, then L*(aj dx l 1\ ... 1\ dx j 1\ dx n) vanish everywhere except on the
portion of aD which maps under a onto H7.
On the other hand,
d(aj dx l 1\ ... 1\

On the other hand, the orientation on Hj is such that this integral has the
sign necessary to make (4.2) hold. This proves Theorem 4.2. 0
As before, we can apply Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 to still more general domains
by using a limit argument. For instance, Theorem 4.2, as stated, does not apply
to the domain D in Fig. 11.8, because the curves C l and C2 are tangent at P.
It does apply, however, to the approximating domain obtained by "breaking
off a little piece" (Fig. 11.9), and it is clear that the values of both sides of (4.2)
for D' are close to those for D. We thus obtain (4.2) for D by passing to the
limit. As before, we will not state a more general theorem covering these cases.
It will be clear in each instance how to apply a limit argument.

Since the statement and proof of Stokes' theorem are so close to those of the
divergence theorem, the reader might suspect that one implies the other. On
an oriented manifold, the divergence theorem is, indeed, a corollary of Stokes'
theorem. To see this, let 0 be an element of /\ n(M) corresponding to the
density p. If X is a vector field, then the n-form DxO clearly corresponds to the
density Dxp = div <X, p>-. Anticipating some notation that we shall introduce in Section 6, let X ...J 0 be the (n - I)-form defined by

5. SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF STOKES' THEOREM

As a simple but important corollary of Theorem 4.2, we state:
Theorem 5.1. Let cp:]I.{ 1 ~ ]I.{ 2 be a differentiable map of the oriented
k-dimensional manifold Ml into the n-dimensional manifold ]I.{ 2. Let w
be a form of degree k - 1 on ]I.{ 2, and let
D C M 1 be a domain with almost regular
q
boundary on MI. Then we have
p

(5.1)
Equation (5.1) follows directly from (4.2)
Fig. 11.10
and from the fact that cp*d = dcp*.
We can regard the right-hand side of (5.1) as the integral of dw over the
"oriented k-dimensional hypersurfaces" cp(D). Equation (5.1) says that this
integral is equal to the integral of w over the (k - I)-dimensional hypersurface cp(aD).

We now give a simple application of Theorem 5.1. Let Co: [0, 1] ~ ]I.{ and
C 1 : [0, 1] ~ M be two differentiable curves with CoCO) = Cl(O) ~ p and
Co(I) = Cl(I) = q. (See Fig. 11.10.) We say that Co andC l are (differentiably)
homotopic if there exists a differentiable map cp of a neighborhood of the unit
square [0,1] X [0,1] C [R2 into ]I.{ such that cp(t,O) = Co(t), cp(t, 1) = Cl(t),
'P(O, s) = p, and cp(I, s) = q. (See Fig. 11.11.) For each value of s we get the
curve C. given by CB(t) = cp(t, s). We think of cp as providing a differentiable
"deformation" of the curve Co into the curve C l .

It is easy to see that the proposition extends without difficulty to piecewise
differentiable curves and piecewise differentiable homotopies. Let us say that
two piecewise differentiable curves, Co and C lI are (piecewise differentiably)
homotopic if there is continuous map cp of [0, 1] X [0, 1] ~ M such that
i) cp(O, s) = p, cp(l, s) = q;
ii) cp(t,O) = Co(t), cp(t, 1) = C 1 (t);
iii) there are a finite number of points to < tl < ... < tm such that cp
coincides with the restriction of a differentiable map defined in some
neighborhood of each rectangle [ti' ti+d X [0, 1]. (See Fig. 11.12.)
To verify that Proposition 5.1 holds for the case of piecewise differentiable
homotopies, we apply Stokes' theorem to each rectangle and observe that the
contribution of the interior vertical lines cancel one another.
We say that a manifold M is connected if every pair of points can be joined
by a (piecewise differentiable) curve. Thus IRn, for example, is connected. We
say that M is simply connected if all (piecewise differentiable) curves joining the
same two points are (piecewise differentiably) homotopic. (Note that the circle,
8 1 is not simply connected.) Let us verify that IR n is simply connected. If Co
and C 1 are two curves, let cp: [0, 1] X [0, 1] ~ IRn be given by

cp(t, s) = sC oCt)

+ (1 -

S)C 1 (t).

It is clear that cp has all the desired properties.

Proposition 5.2. Let M be a connected and simply connected manifold,
and let 0 EM. Let wE /\ I(M) satisfy dw = 0. For any x E M let
f(x) = fe w, where C is some piecewise differentiable curve joining 0 to x.
The function f is well defined and differentiable, and df = w.

Proof. It follows from Proposition 5.1 that f is well defined. If Co and C l are
two curves joining 0 to x, then they are homotopic, and so feo w = fe l w.
It is clear that f is continuous, since
f(x) - fey) =

fD w,

where D is any curve joining y to x (Fig. 11.13).
To check that f is differentiable, let (U, a) be a chart about x with coordinates <Xl, ... , xn>. Then
f(x!, ... , xi

l, ... , xn) = fe w,

where C is any curve joining p to q, where a(p) = (Xl, ... , xi, ... ,x n ), and
where a(q) = (xl, ... , Xi

by
a 0 C(t) = (xl, ... , xi + ht, ... , xn).

We have thus established that every wE /V(/R n ) with dw = 0 is of the
form df. More generally, it can be established that if Q E !\k(/R n ) satisfies
dQ = 0, then Q = dw for some w E !\k-l(/R n ).
*This is not true for an arbitrary manifold. For instance, every w E !\ 1 (8 1)
satisfies dw = O. Yet the element of angle form (which is, unfortunately,
denoted by dO) is not the d of any function. The fact that d 2 = 0 shows that if
Q = dw, then dQ = O. Thus the space d[!\k-l(M)] C !\k(M) is a subspace of
the space kerk d of elements in !\k(M) satisfying dQ = O. The quotient space
kerk d/d[!\k-lj is denoted by Hk(M) and is called the kth cohomology group of
M. If M is compact, it can be shown that Hk is finite-dimensional. It measures
(roughly speaking) "how many" k-dimensional holes there are in M.*

Let M be a differentiable manifold, and let 'P be a flow on M with infinitesimal
generator X. For any W E / \ k(M) we can consider the expression

* - W

t
It is not difficult (using local expressions) to verify that the limit as t ---7 0 exists
and is again an element of /\k(M), which we denote by Dxw. The purpose of
this section is to provide an effective formula for computing Dxw. For this
purpose, we first collect some properties of Dx. First of all, we have that it is
linear:
(6.1)
Secondly, we have
'Pi(WI 1\ W2) -

Dividing by t and passing to the limit, we see that
DX(WI 1\ W2) = (DXWI) 1\ W2

+ WI

1\ DXW2.

(6.2)

Finally, since 'Pi d = d'Pi, we have
Dx dw = d(Dxw).

(6.3)

Actually, these three formulas suffice for the computation. If

Since this expression is rather cumbersome (the d(DxXi) have to be expanded and
the terms collected), we shall derive a simpler and more convenient expression
for D XW. In order to do this, we make an algebraic detour.
Recall that the operator cl: /\k(M) ---7 /\k+I(M) is linear and satisfies the
identity

cl(WI 1\ W2) = clWI 1\ W2 + (_l)kwl 1\ dW2

supp (Jw C supp Wt

(6.5)

will be called an antiderivation of the algebra A(M).
It follows from (6.5) that if WI == W2 on an open set U, then (J(WI) == (J(W2)
on U. Now about every x E lIf we can find a neighborhood U and functions
xl, ... , x n , so that wE A k(M) can be written as
on

U.

(6.6)

Then by repeated use of (6.4') we have

(6.7)

We thus arrive at the important conclusion:
Proposition 6.1. Any antiderivation (J: Ak(M) ---+ AHI(M), k = 0, ... ,n,
is uniquely determined by its action on A o(M) and A I(M). That is, if
(JI(W) = (J2(W) for all wE AO(M) and AI(M), then (JI(Q) = (J2(Q) for
Q E Ak(M) for any k.

Now suppose we are given maps
and
which satisfy (6.5) and (6.4') where it makes sense, that is,
and

(J(fW)

= (J(f)l\lw

+ f(J(w).

(6.8)

Then any chart (U, ex) defines (J: Ak(U) ---+ AHl(U) by (6.7). This
gives an antiderivation (Ju on U, as can easily be checked by the use of the argument on pp. 440-441. By the uniqueness argument, if (W, (3) is a second chart,
the antiderivations (Ju and (Jw coincide on Un W. Therefore, Eq. (6.7) is
consistent and yields a well-defined antiderivation on A(M). (Observe that we
have just repeated about two-thirds of the proof of Theorem 3.1 for the more
general context of any antiderivation.)

t This condition is actually a consequence of (6.4). In fact, let U be an open set
containing supp w. Since {U, lIf-supp w} is an open covering of 1II, we can find a
partition of unity subordinate to it. In particular, we can find a COO-function cP which
is identically one on supp wand vanishes outside U. Then w = cpw, so that

Thus supp (J(w) C supp w U supp cp C U. Since U is an arbitrary neighborhood of
supp w, we conclude that supp (J(w) C supp w.

Also observe that in the above arguments, nothing changes if instead of
0: /\k(M) ~ /\Hl(M) we have 0: /\k(M) ~ /\k-l(M). [We take this to
mean O(f) = 0 for f E / \ O(M).] In fact, the same argument works for
0:

/\k ~ /\Hr

for any odd integer r. We can thus state:

Proposition 6.2. Let 0: AO(M) ~ Ar(M) and 0: Al(M) ~ A r + 1(M) be
linear maps satisfying (6.5) and (6.8), where r is odd. Then there exists one
and only one way of extending 0 to an antiderivation 0: A h(M) ~ A h + reM)
satisfying (6.4).
As an application of this proposition, we will attach an antiderivation
O(X): /\k(M) ~ /\ k-l(M) to every smooth vector field X on AI. Since r = -1,
for f E /\ o(M) we set
O(X)f = o.
For

w

E /\ l(M) we set

O(X)w = (X, w).

(6.9)

To verify (6.8) means to check that
O(X)(fw) = fO(X)w,

that is, that
(X, fw) = f(X, w),
which is obvious.
If f is a function and 0 is an antiderivation, we denote by fO the map which
sends w ~ fO(w). It is easy to check that this is again an antiderivation.
We can assert the following as a consequence of the uniqueness theorem:
Let X and Y be smooth vector fields, and let f and g be smooth functions. Then
O(fX

+ gY)

= fO(X)

+ gO(Y).

(6.10)

By the proposition, it suffices to check (6.10) on all w E /\l(M). By (6.9), this
is just
(fX
gY, w) = f(X, w)
g(Y, w),
which is obvious.

THE LIE DERIVATIVE OF A DIFFERENTIAL FORM

Thus, for example, O(ajax i ) dx P /\ dx q = 0 if neither p = i nor q = i, while
O(ajax i ) (dxi /\ dx i ) = dx i , O(ajaxi)(dx i /\ dx i ) = -dx i , etc.
Let us call a (sequence of) map(s) D: /\k(JI1) ---7 /\H8CM), where s is even,
a derivation if it satisfies (6.5) and

Since s is even, this is consistent. The most important example is Dx
where s = O. Then (6.11) is just (6.2).
All the previous arguments about existence and uniqueness of extensions
apply unchanged to derivations, as can easily be checked. We can therefore
assert:
Proposition 6.3. Let D: /\0(1'01)

---7/\ 0+8(1\f) and D: /\ I(M) ---7/\ H8(1'o1),
where s is even, be maps satisfying (6.5) and (6.8) (with 0 replaced by D).
Then there exists one and only one way of extending D to a derivation of
/\(M).

We need one further algebraic fact.

In fact, by Proposition 6.4, O(X)O(Y)
O(Y)O(X) is a derivation of degree
-2, that is, it vanishes on /\ 0 and /\ 1. It must therefore vanish identically.
We could, of course, directly verify (6.12) from the local description of O(X)
and O(Y).
As a more serious use of Proposition 6.4, consider O(X) 0 d d 0 O(X),
where X is a smooth vector field. Since d: /\k ---7 /\Hl and O(X): /\k ---7 /\k-r,
we conclude that O(X) 0 d + d 0 O(X): /\ k ---7 / \ k. We now assert the main

Since both sides of (6.13) are derivations, it suffices to check (6.13) for
fUllctions and linear differential forms. If j E 1\ o(M), then O(X)j = O. Thus,
by (6.9), Eq. (6.13) becomes
Dxj = (X, df),
which we know holds. Next we must verify (6.13) for wE I\I(M). By (6.5), it,
suffices to verify (6.13) locally. If we write w = al dx l

suffices, by linearity, to verify (6.13) for each term ai dXi. Since both sides of

Since we have verified (6.13) for functions, we only have to check (6.13) for dXi.
Now

[O(X) d

This completes the proof of (6.13).
In many circumstances it will be convenient to free the letter 0 for other uses.
We shall therefore occasionally adopt the notation
X .J w

The symbol .J is called the interior product. X.J w is the interior product of
the form w with the vector field X. If wE 1\\ then X.J w E I\k-l. Equation (6.13) can then be rewritten as

We list here the relationships between notions introduced in this chapter and
various concepts found in books on "vector analysis ", although we shall have
no occasion to use them.
In oricnted Euclidean three-space 1E 3 , there are a number of identifications
we can make which give a special form to some of the operations we have
introduced in this chapter.
First of all, in 1E 3 , as in any Riemann space, we can (and shall) identify
vector fields with linear differential forms. Thus for allY function f we can
regard df as a vector field. As such, it is called grad f. Thus, in 1E 3 , in terms of
rectangular coordinates x, y, z,
gradf =

where we have also identified vector fields on 1E3 with 1E 3-valued functions.
Secondly, since 1E3 is oriented, we can, via the *-operator (acting on each Tn,
identify A 2(1E3) with A 1(1E 3). Recall that * is given by

*(dx 1\ dy) = dz,

*(dx 1\ dz) = -dy,

*(dy 1\ dz) = dx.

Appendix II. ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL
GEOMETRY OF SURFACES IN 1E3

For purposes of computation, it is convenient to introduce the notion of a
vector-valued differential form. Let E be a vector space, and let M be a differentiable manifold. By an E-valued exterior differential form !l of degree p we
shall mean a rule which assigns an element !l:z; to each x EM, where !l:z; is
an antisymmetric E-valued multilinear function of degree p on T:z;(M). For
instance, if p = 0, then an E-valued zero-form is just a function on M with
values in E. An E-valued one-form is a rule which assigns an element of E to
each tangent vector ~ at any point of M, and so on.
Suppose that E is finite-dimensional and that {eb ... , eN} is a basis for E.
Let !lb ... ,!IN be (real-valued) p-forms. We can then consider the E-valued
p-form!l = !llel
!lNeN, where, for any p vectors h, ... , ~p in T:z;(M),
we have

+ ... +

!l:z;(h, ... ,

~p) =

!lIAh, ... ,

~p)el

+ ... + !IN:z;(h, ... , ~p)eN.

Conversely, if !l is an E-valued form, then real-valued forms !lb ... , !IN can
be defined by the above equation. In short, once a basis for an N-dimensional
vector space E has been chosen, giving an E-valued differential form n is the
same as giving N real-valued forms, and we can write
N

!l =

L

!liei

or

I

The rules for local description of E-valued forms, as well as the transition
laws, are similar to those of real-valued forms, so we won't describe them in
detail. For the sake of simplicity, we shall restrict our attention to the case
where E is finite-dimensional, although for the most part this assumption is
unnecessary.
If w is a real-valued differential form of degree p, and if !l is an E-valued
form of degree q, then we can define the form w /\ !l in the obvious way. In
terms of a basis, if!l = -<!lb ... ,!lN >- , then w /\ !l = -< w /\ !lb ... , w /\ !IN>-.
More generally, let E and F be (finite-dimensional) vector spaces, and let #
be a bilinear map of E X F -) G, where G is a third vector space. Let
{eb . .. ,eN}

460

It is easy to check that this does not depend on the particular bases chosen.
\Ve shall want to
this notion primarily in two contexts. First of all,
we will be interested in the case where E = F and G = IR, so that # is a bilinear
form on E. Suppose # is a scalar product and el, ... , eN is an orthonormal basis.
Then we shall write (w 1\ n) to remind us of the scalar product. If

is a ]i-form and n is a q-form, then

as in the case of real-valued forms.
The second case we shall be interested in is where F = G and E = Hom(F),
and # is just the evaluation map evaluating a linear transformation on a vector
of F to give another element of F. This time, choosing a basis for F determines a
basis for Hom(F), so we can regard was a matrix of real-valued differential forms.
If W = (Wij) and n = -< n l , ... , nM >- , then

is an E-valued form of degree p and n is an F-valued form.
We shall apply the notion of vector-valued forms to develop (mostly in
exercise form) some elementary facts about the geometry of oriented surfaces
in IE :l. Let 111 be an oriented two-dimensional manifold, and let 'P be a differentiable map of },1 into 1E3. We shall assume that 'P* is not singular at any point
of M, i.e., that 'P is an immersion. Thus at each point p EO JI the space 'P* (T p(M»)

,'vith 1E 3 , we can regard 'P*(Tp(ilf)) as a two-dimensional subspace of 1E3.
(See Fig. 11.15.) Since M is oriented, so is the tangent plane 'P*(Tp(Nl)).
Therefore, there is a unique unit vector orthogonal to the tangent plane which,

together with an oriented basis of the tangent plane, gives an oriented basis
of 1E3. This vector is called the normal vector and will be denoted by n(p). We
can consider n an 1E 3 -valued function on M. Since Ilnll = 1, we can regard n as
a mapping from M to the unit sphere. Note that cp(M) lies in a fixed plane of 1E3
if and only if n = const (n = the normal vector to the plane). We therefore can
expect the variation of n to be useful in describing how the surface cp(M) is
"bending".
Let 0 be the (oriented) area form on M corresponding to the Riemann metric
induced by cpo Let Os be the (oriented) area form on the unit sphere. Then
n*(Os) is a two-form on M, and therefore we can write
n*Os

The function K is called the Gaussian curvature of the surface cp(M). Note that
K = 0 if cp(M) lies in a plane. Also, K = 0 if cp(M) is a cylinder (see the exercises).
For any oriented two-dimensional manifold with a Riemann metric we
let (f denote the set of all oriented bases in all tangent spaces of M. Thus an
element of (f is given by -<iI, 12 '>, where -<fll 12 '> is an orthonormal basis of
T ",(M) for some x E M. Note that 12 is determined by fl' because of the orientation and the fact that f2 1. II. Thus we can consider (f the space of all tangent
vectors of unit length. For each x E M the set of all unit vectors is just a circle.
We leave it to the reader to verify that (f is, in fact, a three-dimensional manifold.
We denote by 7r the map that assigns to each -<fII f 2'> the point x when
-<fll f2 '> is an orthonormal basis at x. Again, the reader should verify that 7r
is a differentiable map of (f onto M.
In the case at hand, where the metric comes from an immersion cp, we define
several vector-valued functions X, el, e2, and e3 on (f as follows:

that a piece of a cylinder and a piece of the plane are isometric, even though they

only on the Riemann metric induced by the immersion.

From this we conclude that the Gaussian curvature K also does not depend only
on the immersion, but only on the Riemann metric coming from the immersion.
Since Wl2 does not depend on C(J, we should be able to define it for an arbitrary
two-dimensional manifold with a Riemann metric. Note that the preceding
argument shows that Wl2 is uniquely determined by Eq. (11.4). It therefore
suffices to construct an W12 on a coordinate neighborhood so as to satisfy (11.4).
It will then follow from the uniqueness that any two such coincide to give a
well-defined form. Let U be a coordinate neighborhood of M, and let y;: U ---t it

to apply the orthonormalization procedure to the vector fields < ajax!, ajax 2 >-.)
Once we have chosen y;, any basis of Tx differs from y;(x) by a rotation.
If we let 7 denote the (angular) coordinate giving this rotation (so that 7 is
only defined mod 271"), then we can use the local coordinates on U together
with 7 as coordinates on 7I"-I(U). l\lore precisely, if Xl and x 2 are local coordinates on U, we define yl, y2, 7 by

As before, on any two-dimensional Riemann manifold we will call a family
of unit vectors parallel along a curve l' if (~., W12) = O. With this definition of
parallel translation we can state the following:
Theorem. Let l' be any differentiable curve on M. Given the unit vector
E T'Y(o)(M), there is a unique parallel family of unit vectors gl (s) along 1',
with gl (0) = gl. If g~ (0) is another unit vector of T'Y(O)(M) differing from gl
by an angle CT, then g~(s) differs from gl(S) by the same angle CT for all s.

gl

Proof. It is clearly sufficient (by breaking l' up into small pieces if necessary) to
prove the theorem for curves l' lying entirely in a coordinate chart. Then we
can use the local expression for W12.
Let us rewrite the condition for parallel translation along I'(s). In terms of
local coordinates, the unit vector gl (s) is given by a function r(s), where
gl(S) = cos r(s)!l (I'(s») - sin r(s)!2(I'(s»).

which coincides \\"ith the usual notion of parallelism in Euclidean geometry.

This is not true in general.
Exercise II .3.

Let 1'1 and 1'2 be two arcs of great circles joining the north and south
poles on S2. Suppose that 1'1 and 1'2 are orthogonal at the l)oles. Let r be a tangent
vector of the north pole. Compare its translates to the south pole via 1'1 and 1'2.

Let M be any two-dimensional Riemann manifold. For any curve I' on M
there is an obvious way of choosing unit vectors along 1': just let gl(S) be the
unit tangent vector to I' at I'(s). Thus for every curve I' on III we get a curve,
which we shall call y, on 5'. [Here y = (I'(s), gl(S), g2(S) and gl(S) is the
tangent to I'(s).]
We call the form y*(W12) the geodesic curvature form of 1'. [In the Euclidean
case this is just the ordinary curvature (see the exercises).]
Let us consider those curves whose geodesic curvatures vanish, i.e., those
curves whose tangent vectors are parallel. We shall call such a curve a geodesic
with respect to the given Riemann metric. Note that the condition that a curve
be geodesic is given, in local coordinates, by a second-order differential equation. Therefore, a geodesic CO is uniquely specified by giving C(t) and C'(t)
at any fixed value of t. In Chapter 13 we use the term "geodesic" to mean
a curve which locally minimizes length. It is the purpose of the next few exercises
to show that geodesics in our present sense have this property.

y = 0 (that is, the x-axis in the local coordinates), construct the unique geodesic

the geodesic, so that the geodesic passing through (u, 0) is given by

(u, s(u, v»),

where s(u, v) is the s-coordinate of the intersection of the solution curve of Y passing
through (0, v) with the geodesic given by u. (See Fig. 11.17.) Again the existence
theorem and smooth dependence on parameters, together with the fact that the curves
u = 0 and s = 0 are already orthogonal, guarantees that we can find some neighborhood W so that (u, v) are coordinates on W. "We have thus constructed coordinates

(CI/ (v), ir*du) = (C1 (v), dU) = 0,

In particular, the sum of the indices of a vector field is independent of the
vector field, and the total integral of the curvature is independent of the
Riemann metric.
Thus, for instance, if It! is S2, the vector field tangent to the meridian circles
has zeros only at the north and south poles, and the index at each of these
points is +1. Thus (II. 13) says that the sum of indices of any vector field on S2

a/a<PI)p, (aja<PI, a/a<P2)p and (a/a<P2, a/a<P2)p for each p E 111. (These can be given aH
functions of <PI, <P2.) Let h, 12 denote the vector fields obtained by orthonormalizing
a/a<p!, a/a<p2. What is the explicit expression for /l,h?
What is the total area of the torus relative to this Riemann metric?
11.13 In terms of the vector fields h, 12 given in Exercise 11.11 we can introduce
(angular) coordinates <PI, <p2, r on 5'. In terms of these coordinates, what are the
explicit expressions for the vector-valued functions X, p, f2, p, on 5'? (Each of these
vector-valued functions should be given in terms of the fixed standard basis of Euclidean
three-space, i.e., a triplet of functions of <PI, <p2, r.) Thus

X(<p!, <p2, r) =

What are the corresponding expressions for h, 12, and h?
11.14 What are the explicit expressions for the forms WI, W2, and Wl2 on 5' given in
terms of d<PI, d<P2, and dr?
11.15 What is the Gaussian curvature K of M? (Again, K can be given as a function
of <PI, <P2.) For which points of M is the Gaussian curvature positive, and for which
points is it negative?
11.16 On any Riemann manifold there is an obvious way of identifying a linear
differential form with a vector field [via the identification of Ti(M) with Tx(M) given
by the scalar product in T x (ill) J. If g is a function, the vector field associated to the
form dg is denoted by grad g. Let M be the torus with Riemann metric as above, and
let Xl be the function given by XI(<PI, <P2) = (2
cos <PI) cos <P2, as before. Show that
the vector field X = grad Xl vanishes at exactly four points, and compute its index
at each of these points.

3. THE MAXIMUM PRINCIPLE

Equation (2.5) has a number of startling consequences which we shall now
develop. Let U be a function that is harmonic in a domain U. Let Xo be some
point of U, and suppose that there is a neighborhood W of Xo such that W C U
and
U(x) :::; u(xo)
for all x E W.

If there were some point x E Sa with u(x) < u(xo), then u(y) would be less than

inequality would be a strict inequality, i.e.,

!.

u(x o

which contradicts (2.5). We must therefore have
u(x) = u(xo)

for all

Now suppose that W is an open set that is connected; that is, suppose that any
two points of W can be "joined by a continuous curve lying entirely in W. Let y
be any point of W, and let C be a curve joining Xo to y. About each x on the curve
we can find a sufficiently small ball with center x lying entirely in W. By the
compactness of C we can choose a finite number of these balls which cover C.
We can therefore formulate the following: There are a finite number of spheres
Sal' ... , Sak such that each sphere and its interior lie entirely in W, Sal has
center xo, the center Xi of Sam lies on Sa;, and y E Sak' (See Fig. 12.4.) But this
implies that u(xo) = U(Xl) = ... = U(Xk) = u(y). In other words, we have
established:
Proposition 3.1. Let u be harmonic in a connected open set W, and suppose
that u achieves its maximum value at some Xo E W. Then u is constant

on W.
An immediate corollary of this result is:
Proposition 3.2. Let U be a connected open set with D compact. Then if
u is a function that is continuous in D and harmonic in U,

u(x)

unless u is a constant.

GREEN'S FUNCTIONS

479

Proof. In fact, since U is compact and u is continuous, u must achieve its
maximum at some point Xo of U. If we could actually choose Xo E U, then u
would have to be a constant by Proposition 3.1. If u is not a constant, then
Xo E au, and we have (3.1). 0

From this we deduce:
Proposition 3.3. Let U be a connected open set with U compact. Let u
and v be functions that are continuous in U and harmonic in U. Suppose
that
u(y) = v(y)
for all y E au.
Then
u(x) = vex)
foran x E U.

Proof. In fact, u - v satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition 3.2 and vanishes
on au. Thus u(x) - vex) ~ 0 for x E U. Similarly vex) - u(x) ~ 0, which
implies the proposition. 0

An alternative way of formulating Proposition 3.3 is to say that on a domain
U a harmonic function is completely determined by its boundary values. This
is a uniqueness theorem: there is at most one harmonic function with given
boundary values. It suggests the problem of deciding whether the corresponding
existence theorem is true. This problem is known as Dirichlet's problem.
Dirichlet's problem. Given a continuous function f defined on au, does
there exist a function u that is continuous in U and harmonic in U and such
that u(y) = fey) for all y E aU?

We shall show in Section 9 that we can always solve Dirichlet's problem for
domains with almost regular boundary.

Suppose that U is a domain for which the Dirichlet problem can be solved .

(5.3)

In the proof of (5.3) we used the assumption that the function u is differentiable in some neighborhood of the ball BRand is harmonic for Ilxll < R.
Actually, all that we need to assume is that u is differentiable and harmonic for
Ilxll < R and continuous on the closed ball Ilxll ::;; R. In fact, for any Ilxll < R,
Eq. (5.3) will be valid with R replaced by R a , where Ilxll < Ra < R. If we then
let Ra approach R, we recover (5.3) by virtue of the assumed continuity of u.
Equation (5.3) gives the solution of Dirichlet's problem for a ball provided
we know that the solution exists. That is, if u is any function that is harmonic on
the open ball and continuous on the closed ball, it satisfies (5.3). Now let us
show that (5.3) is actually a solution of Dirichlet's problem for prescribed
boundary values. Thus suppose we are given a continuous function u defined on
the sphere SR. Then we are given u(y) for all y E SR. Define u(x) for Ilxll < R
by (5.3). We must show that
a) u is harmonic for Ilxll < R, and
b) u(x) ~ u(Yo) if x ~ Yo and IIYol1 = R.
To prove (a) we observe that GR(X, y) is a differentiable function of x and y
in the range Ilxll < Rl < R, Rl < Ilyll < R2/Rb and is, by construction, a
harmonic function of y. For Ilxll < Rand Ilyll < R, we know, by (4.4), that

GR(x, y)

= GR(y, x).

Thus for fixed y with Ilyll < R, GR(·, y) is a harmonic function on BR - {y}.
Letting lIyll ~ R, we see that GR(X, y) is a harmonic function of x for
IIxll < Rl < R for each fixed y E SR. Thus
aGR
vy'

"""!l'""" (x,

is a harmonic function of x for each yES R. In other words, all the coefficients
of *dG R(·, y) are harmonic functions of x for each y E SR, and therefore so is
each coefficient of u(y) * dG R(·, y). It follows that the function u(x) =
ISR U * dGR(x, .) is a harmonic function of x, since the integral converges uniformly (as do the integrals of the various derivatives with respect to x) for
Ilxll < Rl < R. This proves (a).
To prove (b) we first remark that the constant one is a harmonic function
everywhere, so Eq. (5.3) applies to it. We thus have

CONSEQUENCES OF THE POISSON INTEGRAL FORMULA

We have thus proved:
Theorem 5.1. Let u be a continuous function defined on the sphere SR.

There is a unique continuous function defined for IIxil ~ R which coincides
with the given function on the sphere S R and is hannonic for Ilxil < R.
This function is given by (5.3) for all IIxll < R.

Fig. 12.6
6. CONSEQUENCES OF THE POISSON INTEGRAL FORMULA

In the proof of Theorem 5.1 we assumed that u is continuous in the closed ball,
possesses two continuous derivatives in the open ball, and is harmonic in the
open ball. However, it is clear from (5.3) that u possesses derivatives of all
orders when Ilxll < R. In fact, if IIxll < RI < R, we can differentiate (5.3)
under the integral sign any number of times, since all the integrals we obtain
will be uniformly integrable in Ilxll. Now if u is hannonic in some open set U
and x E U, we can choose R sufficiently small so that the ball of radius R
centered at x will be contained in U. (See Fig. 12.6.) We can then apply (5.3).
We thus conclude:
Proposition 6.1. Let u be a function defined on an open set U, possessing
two continuous derivatives, and satisfying ilu == O. Then u has continuous

derivatives of all orders.
We can improve Proposition 6.1 by examining (5.3) a little more closely.
Let Ilyll = R, and let RI < R. Therefore, all Ilxll ~ R 1 • The multinomial
theorem allows us to expand
(6.1)

where the coefficients depend on y but the series converges unifonnly in x for
all Ilyll = R. Furthennore, if D is any operator of partial differentiation with
respect to x, then we obtain an analogous expansion

where this series is obtained from (5.4) by term-by-term differentiatio:p. and
converges uniformly in the same region. If we now substitute (6.1) into (5.3),
we can integrate the series term by term because of the unifonn convergence in

y, and we conclude that

where the series converges uniformly for Ilxll < R I • Furthermore, we can
differentiate the series term by term. Doing this and evaluating at x = 0,
we see that
alGa = Dau(O),
where a = <aI. ... , an>.
We thus have proved:
Proposition 6.2. Let u be harmonic in the ball Ilxll

u(x) =

~

(6.2)

where the Taylor series (6.2) converges for all IIxll < R and converges
uniformly for all IIxll ::::; RI < R. In particular, u is determined throughout
the ball by its value and the value of all its derivatives at the origin.

Fig. 12.7

Let U be some connected open subset of lEn, and let u and v be two harmonic
functions on U. Suppose that u and v have the same value and the same derivatives of all orders at some point x E U. Let y be some other point of U. We
can then connect x to y by a series of balls lying in U, where the center of each
ball lies in the interior of the preceding ball, and such that x is the center of the
first ball and y lies in the last ball. (See Fig. 12.7.) We thus conclude that
u(y) = v(y).

Thus we have:
Proposition 6.3. Let u and v be harmonic functions defined on an open

connected set U. Suppose that u and v, together with all their derivatives,
coincide at some point of U. Then u == von U. In particular, if u(x) = v(x)
for all x E W, where W is some open subset of U, then u(x) = v(x) for
all x E U.

Let D denote any operator of partial differentiation with respect to x. Thus
aa1 + ... +a n
Dau= ~~----~~~
(aX 1 )al' .. (axn)a n
Then Dau(x) is given by an integral over S R of a function involving, at worst,
inverse powers of Ily - xii for y on SR and the function u on SR. In particular,
if Ilxll < Rl < R, then we can estimate the maximum absolute value of Da u
in terms of the values of u on S R and the difference R - R 1. In short,
IDau(x)1 :::; c(D a, R, Rd max lu(y)1

liyli=R

(6.3)

where c depends only on 0', R, and R 1 • Now suppose that u is harmonic in some
open set U, and let Kl and K2 be compact subsets of U with

We can also draw a ball B R,x of slightly smaller radius about x. Now the open
balls B R,x cover K 1. Since K 1 is compact, we can select a finite number of these
balls which cover K 1 • By applying (6.3) to each of these balls, replacing lu(y)1
by the larger maxzEK2 lu(z)l, and using the smallest of the finitely many constants c, we conclude that

In particular, we have:
Proposition 6.4. Let

{Uk} be a sequence of harmonic functions defined on
an open set U that converges uniformly on any compact subset of U. Then
the sequence of partial derivatives {Da u} also converges uniformly on any
compact subset. In particular, the limit of the sequence is again a harmonic
function.

In fact, for any compact subset K 1 we can always find a compact subset K2
such that K 1 C int K 2 • Applying (6.4) to the harmonic functions u, - Uj
establishes the uniform convergence of {Da Uk } on K 1 . Since the sequence of
partial derivatives converges uniformly, flu = lim flUk = O.
7. HARNACK'S THEOREM

We continue to reap the consequences of Eq. (5.3). In addition to what we
assumed in the preceding section, let us suppose that u(y) 2: 0 for all y E SR.

sequence of balls, we deduce:
Proposition 7.1 (Harnack's theorem). Let {Uk} be a sequence of harmonic
functions defined on a connected open set U and such that

(7.2)

Suppose that the sequence {Uk(P)} converges for some p E U. Then the
sequence of functions {Uk} converges uniformly on any compact subset of U
and, by Proposition 6.4, the limit function is again harmonic.

12.8

SUBHARMONIC FUNCTIONS

489

A useful variation of Harnack's theorem is:
Proposition 7.2. Let {Uk} be a sequence of harmonic functions defined on
an open set U and satisfying (7.2). Suppose that there is a constant M such
that Uk(X) < M for all k and all x E U. Then the sequence of functions
{Uk} converges uniformly on any compact subset of U to a harmonic
function.

To prove Proposition 7.2 we remark that this time the convergence of
{Uk(X)} at each x E U is automatic because it is a monotone (nondecreasing)
sequence of bounded real numbers. Proposition 7.1 guarantees that the convergence is uniform on compact subsets to a harmonic limit function.
8. SUBHARMONIC FUNCTIONS

In this section and the next we shall show that Dirichlet's problem can be solved
for bounded open sets U whose boundaries satisfy certain regularity conditions.
The proof that we shall present (there are many others) is due to Perron and
makes essential use of the concept of a subharmonic function. Let U be a function
defined on the open set U. We say that U is subharmonic if
a)

U

is continuous; and

b) for any connected open subset W of U and any harmonic function, v
defined on W, the function U - v satisfies the maximum principle on W.
In other words, for any such Wand v, if there is some Xo E W with

U(X) - v(x) :::; u(xo) - v(xo)
then u(x) - v(x)

= u(xo) -

for all

x E W,

v(xo) in W.

In order to understand condition (b) a little better, we study some of its
consequences. First of all, we can let v be the harmonic function that is identically zero. Then (b) says that U satisfies the maximum principle on every open
subset of U.
Next we let BR be some ball with center z whose closure is contained in U.
In particular, its boundary, SR, is contained in U, and the function U is continuous on SR. We can therefore find a harmonic function v defined on the open
ball and taking on the values u(y) for y E SR. We take W to be the open ball
and v to be the function we have just constructed. Then u - v vanishes on SR,
so (b) implies that u(x) :::; v(x) for all x E W. In particular, u(z) :::; v(z). But

In other words, a subharmonic function is always less than or equal to its average value over a sphere about a point. This property is frequently taken as the
definition of a function's being subharmonic, and the hypothesis of continuity is
somewhat relaxed. However, the definition we gave above is more suitable for
our present purposes.
Let WI and W2 be two subharmonic functions defined on an open set U.
Define the function WI V W2 by setting
(WI

V W2)(X)

=

max

[WI (X),

W2(X)],

The function WI V W2 is again subharmonic. The fact that WI V W2 is continuous is established as follows: Let x be any point of U. Then WI V W2(X) is
either WI(X) or W2(X), say WI(X). Since WI is continuous, for any E > 0, we can
find a 0 > 0 such that IWI(Y) - wI(x)1 < E for IY - xl < o. Similarly, we
can arrange to have W2(Y) < W2(X)
E for that same range of y, so that
W2(Y) < WI(X)
E, since WI(X) = max [WI(X), W2(X)].
For these values of Y
we thus have
WI(X) - E < WI(Y) :::; WI V W2(Y) < WI(X)
E,

+

+

+

so that WI V W2 is continuous. Now let W be a connected open subset of U
and let v be a harmonic function on W. Suppose that WI V W2 - v takes on
its maximum value at some point Xo of W. Suppose that WI V W2(XO) =
WI(XO)' Then for all x E W
WI(X) - v(x) :::;

WI

V W2(X) - v(X) :::; WI(XO) - v(xo).

Since WI is subharmonic, the right and left sides of this inequality must be equal.
Thus WI V W2 - v satisfies the maximum principle on W, which shows that
WI V W2 is subharmonic.
Let W be a subharmonic function defined on an open set U, and let B be a
ball whose closure is contained in U. Let u be the solution of Dirichlet's problem
for the ball B with boundary values w. Thus u is the unique function continuous
in the closed ball, harmonic in the open ball, and coinciding with W on the
boundary S of B. As we have already observed, w(x) :::; u(x) for x E B. Now
define the function W B by setting
WB(X)

=

{ W(X)
u(x)

for
for

x E U - B,
x E B.

We claim that the function WB is again subharmonic. The proof is just as before.
The continuity is obvious, as before. If W is subset of U and v is a harmonic
function on W, then WB - v cannot achieve a strict maximum at any interior
point: suppose WB(X) - v(x) :::; WB(XO) - v(xo) for all x E W. (See Fig. 12.9.)
If Xo E U - B, then we have w(x) - v(x) :::; WB(X) - v(x) :::; WB(XO) - v(xo) =
w(xo) - v(xo). Since W is subharmonic, all these inequalities must be equalities.
On the other hand, if Xo E B, then since WB is harmonic in the open ball, we must
have WB(X) - v(x) = WB(XO) - v(xo) for all x E W. By continuity, this implies

12.9

DIRICHLET'S PROBLEM

that WB(Y) - v(y) = WB(XO) - v(xo) for yEW n S. If W n S ;;t!= 0, we can
take y as a new Xo and the problem is reduced to the previous case.
In short, to every subharmonic function W defined on U we have attached
another subharmonic function WB such that WB is actually harmonic in the
interior of B and coincides with W in U - B, and such that W :::; WB throughout
U. It is clear from the method of construction that if WI and W2 are two subharmonic functions defined on U with WI :::; W2, then

9. DIRICHLET'S PROBLEM

Let f be a bounded function defined on aU, and suppose that If(p) I < M for all

following two conditions:
a) each W E Wj is subharmonic; and
b) for each p E au,
lim sup w(x) :::; f(p).

and each e

Note that the family of functions Wf is nonempty, since the constant function
which is identically -M clearly belongs to Wf. Also note that condition (b)
implies that lim sup w(x) < M as x --t aU. Since W E Wf is subharmonic, we
conclude from the maximum principle that Iwi < M for all W E Wf'
Now define the function Uf by setting
Uf{X) =

lub w(x).
wEW,

In view of the preceding remarks, the function Uf is well defined and, in fact,
lu(x)1 < M for all x E U. We shall show that if f is continuous on au, the
function Uf is the solution of the Dirichlet problem for U. We must thus show
that Uf is harmonic and takes on the boundary values f.
We first show, without any continuity restrictions onf, that Uf is harmonic.
To do this it is sufficient to show that uf is harmonic in any open ball B, where
13 c U. Let x be some point of B. Let WI, W2, •.• , Wk, ••• , be a sequence of
functions belonging to Wf such that lim Wi(X) = uf(X). (Such a sequence
exists by the definition of Uf.) Now define

Then w~ ::; w~ ::; . . . ::; w~ ::; ... is a monotone increasing sequence of functions belonging to Wf with lim w~(x) = Uf(X). Now replace each w~ by W~B'
The function WiB belongs to W" since it is subharmonic and coincides with w~
near aU. Furthermore, since W ::; WB for any subharmonic function, we can
conclude that lim W:B(X) = Uf(X). Inside the ball B, each of the functions W:B
is harmonic, so that the sequence {W:B} is a monotone nondecreasing sequence
of harmonic functions in B. Since all the functions of Wf are bounded by M,
we conclude from Proposition 7.2 that the sequence {W:B} converges uniformly
on any compact subset of B to a function U which is harmonic in B, and we have
uf(X) = u(x). Furthermore, by definition, we have u(y) ::; Uf(Y) for any y E B.
We would like to show that we actually have u(y) = uf(Y) for all such y. To this
effect, we follow the same procedure at y, namely, we select a sequence {V:B}
where each V:B is harmonic in B, belongs to W" and is such that the sequence is
monotone nondecreasing and lim V:B(Y) = Uf(Y). In this way we obtain another
function v which is harmonic in B and satisfies v ::; Uf throughout B, and
v(y) = Uf(Y). Finally, let the functions 8i be defined by

12.9

and consider the functions SiB. On the one hand, they all belong to W, and are
harmonic in B. Furthermore, we have W:B :::; SiB and ViB :::; $iB. Finally, the
sequence {SiB} is nondecreasing and therefnre converges to a harmonic function
8 in B. By construction, we have

"":::;S

and

v :::;

throughout B, while u(x) = 8(X) = uAx) and u(y) = 8(y) = u,(y). Applying
the maximum principle to the harmonic functions u - 8 and v - 8, we conclude
(since the maximum value 0 is achieved at x and y, respectively) that S =
u = v in all of B. We thus see that u,(y) = u(y) for any y E B, which shows
that
is harmonic in U. Note that in proving that
is harmonic we did not
make use of any properties of the boundary of U or any continuity assumptions

Now the function b is continuous and vanishes at p. Thus by choosing x
sufficiently close to p we can arrange that the right-hand side of (9.3) is less than
2E. Thus Uf(X) -+ f(p) as x -+ p.
In particular, if all points of au are touchable, and if f is continuous at all
points of the boundary, we have proved:
Theorem 9.1. Let U be an open subset of P with compact closure and
touchable boundary. Let f be a continuous function defined on au. Then
there exists a unique function Uj which is continuous on V and harmonic
in U, and which coincides with f on aU.
Some remarks concerning Theorem 9.1 and its proof are in order.
a) The only time we used the assumption that aU is touchable was when
we constructed a function b which was subharmonic in V, vanished at p, and took
on values less than some negative constant on all points of au outside some
neighborhood of p. Now a more careful analysis will show that we can always
construct such a function so long as we can touch p from the outside by a cone.
Thus we can solve the Dirichlet problem even at points like the p in Fig. 12.12.

Fig. 12.12

b) On the other hand, some condition on the boundary is necessary. For
instance, if aU contains an isolated point p, then we cannot assign the value at p
arbitrarily. In fact, if U is continuous in a neighborhood W of p and harmonic in
W - {p}, then the Poisson integral formula implies that the various derivatives
of U will also be bounded in W - {p}. Therefore, the proof of the mean-value
theorem applies to the point p itself, and so u(p) is determined and cannot be
assigned arbitrarily. More generally, a more delicate argument shows that
the Dirichlet problem cannot be solved for domains whose boundaries contain spikes pointing inward or (in dim ~3) sufficiently sharp cusps (as in

12.10

sharp conductor cannot hold a charge, but will spark. (The relation with
electrostatics will be discussed in Section 12.)
c) For the purpose of applying the results of Section 4, i.e., the construction
of the Green function of the domain and the various identities, Theorem 9.1
is still not quite enough. We need to know not only that the Green function
exists, but also that it has continuous derivatives up to the boundary. This fact
requires further argument and additional assumptions about the nature of the
boundary; it will be discussed in the next section.

Proof. Let p be some point of au, and let us arrange, by a Euclidean motion,
that the tangent plane to au at p is the plane xn = O. (See Fig. 12.14.) Then
near p the points of aU are all points of the form (Xl, ... , xn-I, cp(xI, ... , X n - l )),

all q near p) find a constant A such that
If(q) I :$ Alb(q)1

for all q E

Since the function b is harmonic in U, the maximum principle applied to u - Ab
and Ab - u allows us to conclude that
lu(x)1 :$ Alb(x)1

for all x E U.

(10.4)

Now the function b is a differentiable function of the distance from z which
vanishes when this distance is R. In particular, there is a constant a > 0
such that
Ib(x)1 :$ a d(x),
where d(x) denotes the distance from x to the sphere of radius R with center z.
Now let B be the ball of radius R with center -z = (0, ... ,0, R), so that B
lies in U, and let S = aB. Note that S is tangent to the sphere about z at the
point p. (See Fig. 12.16.) Thus for points y on S, d(y) :$ cillY - p1l2. If we
substitute this into (10.4) using the previous inequality, we conclude that

Since the sphere is (n - l)-dimensional, this last integral converges absolutely,
and we thus see that the first integral in (10.6) is uniformly absolutely convergent. (Note that the term containing this integral vanishes if i < n.) We now
show that the second term in (10.6) tends to zero as xn tends to zero. In fact,
R2 - /Ix + zl/2 = xn(2R - x n), so we can write the second term of (10.6) as

(2R - xn) (xn) 1/2 I (xn) 1/2U(Y) (Xi _ yi)
A n- 1R
I/x - yl/n+2

This time, since xn ~ I/x - yl/ for all YES, we can assert that the integrand

I/y - xl/n+3/2 - I/y - xl/n+l/2 - I/y - pl/n+l/2 ,
which is again absolutely integrable. Therefore, the integral occurring in the
last expression is uniformly bounded for all values of xn ~ o. Since (xn) 1/2 --7 0,
we conclude that the second term of (10.6) approaches zero.
If we now rephrase the result we have obtained independently of the
special choice of coordinates, we see that we have proved the following: Let p
be any point of au, and let x be a point on the normal line to au through p.
If ~ is any vector parallel to a tangent vector at p, then (~, du) --7 (~, df) as
x --7 p along the normal line. If a/an denotes the unit vector in the normal

where the integral is taken over the sphere of radius R tangent to au at p and
lying inside U.
SO far, we have proved convergence only if x --7 p along the normal direction.
If we go back and examine the argument, we see that the radius R and the
constant D in (10.5) can be chosen uniformly for all p E au. (In fact, since aU
is compact, we can cover au by a finite number of neighborhoods, of type (iii),
such that a ball of radius R about each p E aU lies in one of these neighborhoods,
where R is sufficiently small. In such a situation it is clear that the choice of R
(still smaller, if necessary) depends only on the second derivatives of the change
of charts from Euclidean coordinates to the adjusted charts. Also the choice
of D depends only on the constants involved in the Taylor expansion of f and
on R. Thus the choice of Rand D can be made uniformly.) Since, byassump-

12.11

tion, the partial derivatives of f are continuous and the right-hand side of (10.7)
is continuous in p, we conclude that the limits of the partial derivatives of u
exist as we approach the boundary in any direction, and that in fact we have
proved Theorem 10.1. 0
We can now construct a Green function for any domain with regular
boundary by the solution of Dirichlet's problem, as in Section 4. Theorem 10.1
tells us that it is differentiable in the closed set V in the sense that the partial
derivatives are continuous up to the boundary. If we want to derive the various
formulas of Section 4, we can do so by applying a limit argument: We simply
replace V by a smaller domain va such that va ~ V and aVa ~ av as a ~ o.
(Actually, a more careful and delicate argument will show that if f has two
continuous derivatives, then the auj axi we obtain as limits on the boundary are
in fact continuously differentiable. Since aujax i is the solution of the Dirichlet
problem with these boundary values, we conclude that the second derivatives
of u can be extended so as to be continuous on V. In this way one can prove that
if f is C~, all the derivatives of u can be extended so as to be continuous on V.
In particular, all the derivatives of the Green function G(x, .) can be extended
to continuous functions at the boundary for any x E V.)
11. DIRICHLET'S PRINCIPLE

The solution of Dirichlet's problem has an interesting and useful characterization as the solution of the problem of minimizing the Dirichlet integral
D[u, u] = J'L (aujax i )2 with given boundary values. More precisely,
Let V be a domain with compact
closure and regular boundary, and let f be a continuously differentiable
function on aV. Let u be the solution of the Dirichlet problem with
boundary values f, and let w be any function which is differentiable in V
and takes on the values of f on the boundary, and whose derivatives can
be extended to be continuous in V. Then
Theorem 11.1 (Dirichlet's principle).

and equality holds if and only if u = w.

= u + v, where now v is continuously differentiable on
V, continuous on V, and vanishing on av. Then

Proof. Let us write w

D[w, w] = D[u

+ v, u + v] =

D[u, u]

+ D[v, v] + 2D[u, v],

(11.2)

since D is bilinear and symmetric in its arguments.
Now suppose for the moment that u possesses two continuous derivatives
and v possesses one continuous derivative in a neighborhood of V. Then

Now D[v, v] = J'L. (av/ax i )2 ~ 0 and vanishes if and only if all the derivatives
of v vanish, so that v is a constant on each component of U. Since v vanishes on
au, we conclude that D[v, v] = 0 if and only if v = O.
In case u and v are not necessarily differentiable in a neighborhood of au,
we establish that D[u, v] = 0 by writing

Du[u, v] = lim Dua[u, v],
where Ua is a sequence of domains which approach U as a ~ 0 and aU a ~ au.
Applying the previous argument to each of the domains U a , we conclude that
D[u, v] = 0 and D[v, v] = 0 if and only if v = O. This proves the theorem. 0
12. PHYSICAL APPLICATIONS

The study of Laplace's equation and its solutions plays an important role in
many theories of classical physics. This is essentially due to the intimate
connection between the Laplace operator and Euclidean geometry. Since this
is not the place to elaborate on the physical applications, we refer the reader to
any physics text for the details. (See, for instance, Feynman, Leighton, and
Sands, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass.,
1964, vol. II, especially Chapter 12.) We shall briefly mention some of the
relevant physics in this section.
In electrostatics it is assumed that the electric field E satisfies the equations
d

*E

=

p,

dE= 0,

where p is the density of charge and we identify the vector field E with a linear
differential form via the Euclidean metric on 1E3. Here p is assumed, for the
moment, to be a smooth density. (It is also convenient to consider the limiting
cases of "surface distributions" and "point distributions".) By the second of
these equations, we know that E can be written as
E =

-dcp,

where cp is a smooth function known as the potential of the electric field. The
first equation then implies that
Acp = d

* dcp =

-po

H p is given, then cp is determined by the formula

cp(y) = 471'

(since A2 = 471'). As limiting cases, we obtain, for charge distributed along a

where l ds is a linear distribution along a curve C.
For a point charge located at x, we obtain

Fig. 12.17

where e is the magnitude of the charge.
There can be no electric field along a conductor (since this would result in a
motion of the charge, which contradicts the assumption of a static field). Thus
and

IP

= const.

In most problems that arise the distribution of charge is not known in
advance, but must be determined. For example, suppose that a unit charge is
placed at a point x inside a cavity whose boundary is a conductor which is
grounded, i.e., kept at zero potential. (See Fig. 12.17.) We want to find the
electric field inside the cavity. There will be a charge distribution induced on
the boundary surface that we also wish to determine. Since there is no charge
distribution anywhere inside the cavity, except at x, the potential IP must be
harmonic everywhere except at x, and, in fact, differs from
1

by a harmonic function. Since we want IP = 0 on the boundary, we see that the
desired potential IP is exactly the Green function for the domain. The surface
density can then be determined from dIP along the boundary. (This is another
reason why it is important to know that the solution of Dirichlet's problem is
differentiable at the boundary.)
More frequently, we are interested in the electric field outside conducting
surfaces. Here, strictly speaking, the theory we have developed of Dirichlet's
problem does not apply, since we considered only bounded domains. We can
handle this problem in one of two ways. First, we can reduce to the Dirichlet
problem by considering everything contained inside a very large conducting
sphere (at potential zero). Then we let the radius go to infinity to get the
desired potential as a limit. Second, we can modify our arguments in SeCtions 3
through 10 to include the case of unbounded domains, but restrict all our functions to vanishing as clr at infinity. The details are left to the reader.
In the theory of diffusion one assumes that material of some nature is
flowing according to a vector field X. If the density of the material is p dV,

502

POTENTIAL THEORY IN

lEn

12.12

then the amount of material flowing per unit time through an oriented piece of
surface S is given by

Is

p(X, n) dA =

Is

*pX,

where n is the unit normal vector to the surface, dA is the element of area, and,
we are regarding pX on the right-hand side as a linear differential form via the
Euclidean metric. Thus the net amount of material flowing out of any region is
d * pX = div -< X, p>-. Now "material" may be produced in the region at a rate
s dV (where s is the function describing the rate of productivity of the sources
in the region). Thus the total change of density is given by

~~ dV =

div -<X, p>- - s dV.

If, as we shall assume, the situation is stationary, i.e., the density does not
change, we obtain the equations
div -<X, p>-

=

s dV.

On the other hand, it frequently happens that the flow is given by the gradient
of some function, i.e.,
PidX = dN
for some function N. Combining these equations, we obtain

I1N

=

s.

In the theory of heat N is the temperature, PidX is the rate of flow of heat, and
s is the density of the sources of heat. The equation PidX = dN says that the
rate of flow of heat is proportional to the gradient of temperature. In the theory
of diffusion of particles it is assumed that the rate of flow of the material is
proportional to the change (i.e., gradient) of the density of the particles. (This
says that the particles tend to flow from a region of higher density to a region
of lower density.) Then N represents the density of the particles and s represents
the rate of production of particles.
Suppose, for example, that the boundary of a region D is kept at some fixed
temperature j, where j is a given function on aD and there are no sources of heat
inside D. Then the distribution of temperature in D is given by the function N
which satisfies the differential equation I1N = 0 and the boundary condition
N = j on aD. In other words, the temperature is determined by the solution
of Dirichlet's problem.
In the theory of steaily, incompressible, il'rotational flow of a fluid it is assumedthat a vector field X is given which represents the flow of the liquid. By the
incompressibility it follows that d * X = O. It is assumed that there is no
circulation, that is, dX = O. Thus X = dcp for some function cp which is a
solution of Laplace's equations. The natural boundary-value problems that arise
in this case are different from those we have been discussing, so we simply refer
the reader to standard works on fluid mechanics.

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

In this chapter we shall present a brief introduction to the study of classical
theoretical mechanics. We emphasize that what we are studying is a branch
of mathematics-idealized from the mathematical considerations common to
many problems arising in the physics of mechanical systems. We will thus
formulate, on an axiomatic basis, a mathematical model that describes features
that arise in the study of the equations of mechanics. The model will apply to
most situations arising in the mechanical applications. In order to simplify the
mathematics, we have sacrificed a certain amount of generality, and therefore
there will be some situations in classical mechanics where our model is inadequate.
Mechanics is devoted to the study of how a physical system evolves in time.
The first fundamental assumption is that the system can be described (locally)
by a collection of continuous parameters. More precisely, we assume that the
set of all possible "positions" or configurations of the physical system is a
differentiable manifold M which is called the configuration space.
For example, if the physical system consists of three particles free to move
in space, we can describe the "position" of the system at any given instant by
giving the positions of each of the three particles. Thus, in this case, the configuration space is
1E3 X 1E3 X 1E 3.
H we insist that no two particles be able to occupy the same position of space at
the same time, then the configuration space M is given by

M = 1E3 X 1E3 X 1E3 - S,
where

s=

{-<Vb V2, V3

>- : Vi

E

1E3 and

VI

=

V2

or VI

=

V3

or V2

=

V3}.

If the physical system is a rigid body (say a top) spinning about some point
held fixed in space, then the position of the system is completely described by
giving the position in space of three orthonormal vectors on the body (drawn
through the fixed point, say). Since these vectors can be placed in any position
but must remain orthonormal and cannot change orientation (from right- to
left-handedness), we see that M is the set of all oriented orthonormal bases of 1E 3 •
In this case M is a three-dimensional manifold. If we fix some arbitrary initial
orthonormal basis -< eb e2, e3>-, then any possible position of the system is
509

510

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

given by -< VI, V2, V3 >-, where Vi = Aei and A is a rotation, that is, A is an
orthogonal linear transformation with positive determinant. Thus M is diffeomorphic to 0+(3), the space of all orthogonal three-by-three matrices with
positive determinant.
The basic problem of mechanics is to describe how the configuration of the
system changes in time. As the system evolves, the configuration at any instant
t will be given by some point G(t) EM. Our problem is to give a reasonably
simple description of the possible curves G which can arise as actual changes
in the configuration of the mechanical system.
The second fundamental assumption of classical mechanics is that the
curve G(t) can be determined from a knowledge of the "state" of the system
at any given time. That is, we may (and, in general, will) have to know more
about the system at a given time than its configuration in order to be able to
predict its future configuration. However, if we do have enough such instantaneous information, we can determine the curve G(t). The total amount of
relevant information is called the state of the system. It is assumed that the set
of all states is itself a differentiable manifold, S. Since the state of a system contains more information than the configuration, we can assign to every state s the
configuration 1I'(s) EM of the system in the state s. In other words, we have a
map 11': S -- M. We assume that this map 11' is differentiable.
It is assumed that if we know the state s of the system at time to, we can
predict its state at any future time t. Thus we are given a map
'Pt,to: S -- S

such that if the system is in the state s at time to, it will be in the state 'Pt,to(s)
at time t. Now there is nothing special about the time to. If t > tl > to and s
is the state at time to, then 'Ptl,tO(S) is the state at time h, and therefore
'Pt,tl ('Ptl,tO(S»

is the state at time t.
In other words,
Now it turns out that in most (basic) mechanical systems, if the time is suitably
parametrized, the function 'Pt,to really depends only on t - to. (This fails to
hold in the so-called nonconservative systems. A typical nonconservative
system is one involving friction. This is usually a consequence of not studying
a sufficiently complete system. In the case of friction, for example, the heat loss
must be taken into account.) Let us assume that 'Pt,to depends only on t - to.
Then, if we write
and
then the previous equation can be written as

13.1

THE TANGENT AND COTANGENT BUNDLES

511

This looks like the defining relation for a one-parameter group except that so
far we have been restricting ourselves to nonnegative values of 8. In point of
fact, it is assumed that this restriction is unnecessary and, in fact, we are given
a flow ep on S.
To repeat, we are given a differentiable manifold M representing the set of
all possible configurations of our system, a differentiable manifold S representing
all possible states of the system, a differentiable map 1r: S ~ M, and a flow ep on
S. Then the curves C(t) are all assumed to be of the form
C(t)

=

1rep/(x)

for some

xES.

We must therefore describe S, 1r, and ep for any given configuration space M.
Classical mechanics makes a very definite assumption about the nature of the
space S (and the map 1r). It asserts that the state of a system is completely
determined by its (configuration and its) "momentum". What is the momentum
of our abstract setup? As usual, the momentum should be something that resists
change in velocity. It turns out that an appropriate object representing "infinitesimal resistance to change in istantaneous velocity" is a cotangent vector. A
heuristic motivation for this, which the reader may choose to ignore, is the following: At any given configuration x EM, the set of all possible velocity vectors
is just TAM). At any given v E Tx(M), a "resistance to change in v" would be
some function defined near v and vanishing at v. To first order we could replace
such a function by its differential. Thus "infinitesimal resistance" is a linear
function on Tv(Tx(M). Since Tx(M) is a vector space, we may identify
Tv(Tx(M) with TxCM) for each v. Thus all possible "momenta" become identified with all elements of T:(M).
The set S is thus taken to be the set of all momenta, i.e., the set of all
cotangent vectors at all points of M. We must first show how to make this
space into a differentiable manifold.
1. THE TANGENT AND COTANGENT BUNDLES

Let M be a differentiable manifold, and let us consider the set T(M) of all
tangent vectors to all points of M. Thus
T(M)

= U

Tx(M).

xEM

Let 1r denote the map of T(M) onto M which assigns to each tangent vector the
point of M at which it is defined; that is, if ~ E Tx(M), then 1r(~) = x. We
claim that T(M) can be made into a differentiable manifold in a natural way,
so that 1r is a differentiable map. In fact, let a be an atlas on M. For any
(U, a) E a, define T(a): 1r- 1 (U) ~ V E9 V by setting
T(aH

= -< a(x),

~a

if

We claim that the collection (1r- 1 U, T(a) is an atlas on T(M). To check that

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

T(a) is one-to-one, we observe that if ~ E T",(M) and 'T/ E TII(M) with x ~ y,
then a(x) ~ a(y); while if ~ ~ 'T/ and both lie in T",(M), we have ta ~ 'T/a.
To check that the transition law is satisfied, we note that Eq. (4.3), Chapter 9
implies that if (U, a) and (W, (3) are two charts of ct,

for <v, ~a>- E T(a)7r- l (U n W), that is, v E a(U n W) and ~a arbitrary
in V.
The fact that the structure on T(M) does not depend on the choice of (j,
is obvious. That 7r is differentiable is also clear; in fact, (7r- l (U), T(a)) and
(U, a) are compatible charts in terms of which a 0 7r 0 T(a)-l(v, ~a) = v. We
call T(M), together with its structure as a differentiable manifold, the tangent
bundle of M.
If M is finite-dimensional, let (U, a) be a chart of M with coordinates
xl, ... , xn, so that
a(x)

=

<xl(x), ... , xn(x) >- E IRn.

We will denote the coordinates associated to the chart T(a) on 7r- l (U) by
<ql, ... , qn, qt, ... , ct>-. Hence if ~ E T",(M), where x E U, we have
T(a)(~)

=

<a(x), ~a><ql(~),

so that

In other words, the qi are just the coordinates Xi regarded as functions on T(M)
via 7r, and the qi(~) are the components of ~ relative to the basis

We can follow a similar procedure for
T*(M)

define the map

(j,

of M,

by setting
T*(a) (l) =

<a(x), la >-

(1.4)

for l E T:(M) and x E U. As before, this defines an atlas on T*(M) which,
in turn, defines a differentiable structure on T*(M) which is independent of the
choice of atlas of M. (Note that we have used the same letter, 7r, to denote the
two projections: that of T(M) ~ M and that of T*(M) ~ M. Whenever there
is any confusion, we shall denote these maps by 7rT and 7rT*.)

EQUATIONS OF VARIATION

we shall denote the coordinates of (n·-l(U), T*(a)) by

Thus, if l E T:(M), where x E U, we have

2. EQUATIONS OF VARIATION

Let M 1 and M 2 be two differentiable !nanifolds, and let cp: M 1 ~ M 2 be a differentiable !nap. Then cp induces a map T(cp) of T(M 1) ~ T(M 2) when we set

(2.1)
To check that T(cp) is differentiable, let us choose compatible charts (U, a) on
M 1 and (W, (3) on M 2. Then it follows from the definition of T(cp) that

(T(U), T(a))

(T(W), T({3))

In other words, the diagram

T(M l ) to M 2.
In particular, if {CPI} is a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms of M, we
get a one-parameter group T(CPI) on T(M), where, by (2.4),

If M is finite-dimensional,

Note that Eqs. (2.8) are just the local equations corresponding to the vector field

sents, to linear approximation, how solution curves of X near cp(x) are deviating
from cp(x).
We now go through a similar construction for the cotangent bundle. If
cp: M 1 ~ M 2 is a differentiable map, then CP:: T;(x)(M 2) ~ T:(M 1) is going in
the wrong direction. We therefore restrict our attention to maps which are
locally diffeomorphisms, and we define T*(cp) by setting

3. THE FUNDAMENTAL LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL FORM ON T*(M)

Before returning to our study of mechanics, we study in some detail the geometry
of the cotangent bundle. Let M be a differentiable manifold, and let z be a point
of T*(M). Let ~ be a tangent vector to T*(M) at the point z, so that
~ E Tz(T*(M)).

Then 7r*~ is an element of Tr(z)(M). Since z E
T r(z)(M), we can consider the expression

T~(z)(M)

is a linear function on

(7r*~, z)

which depends linearly on

~.

We denote this linear function of ~ by 8z • We have

516

13.3

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

thus defined a linear differential form 8 on T*(M) by setting
(3.1)
The form 8 is called the fundamental linear form of T*(M). Let us obtain the
expression for 8 in terms of a chart (-71·- 1(U), T*(a). Since T*(a) maps '7I'"-l(U)
onto an open set, 0 of V ED V*, the expression 8T*(a) should be a function from
o to (V ED V*)* which can be identified with V* ED V. Let us evaluate this
function. In terms of the chart (U, a) on M and ('7I'"-l(U), T*(a) on T*(M),
we have
h*(a) =

-<v, w*> E

V

and

ED V*

so that
('71'"*~,

z) = (v, za) .

. Thus ( -< v, w* >, (8 zh*(a» = (v, Za); that is,
(8 zh*(a)

= -<Za, 0>

E V* ED V

= (V ED V*)*.

In other words, the local expression 8a for the differential form 8 in terms of
the chart T*(a) is given by

If M is finite-dimensional and we use the local coordinates

Of course, (3.3) is just a way of writing (3.2) in terms of a basis of V = IRn.
Let cp: M 1 ~ M 2 be a diffeomorphism, let 81 be the fundamental linear form
on T*(M 1), and let 82 be the fundamental linear form on T*(M 2). Let

T*(cp)z)

= (~, Biz).

In other words,
(3.4)

In particular, if {cpt} is a flow on M, then
(T*(cpt»)*B = B.
If X is a vector field on M, then the infinitesimal version of the last equation is

DT*(x)B

= o.

(3.5)

Note that any vector field X on M defines a functionfx on T*(M) by
fx(z)

= (X20' z)

if 'II"(z)

= x.

(3.6)

We also have
fx = (T*(X), B},

(3.7)

since (T*(X)z, Bz) = ('II"*T*(X)z, z) = (X20' z) by (2.15).
Finally, in view of (3.5) and Eq. (6.14), Chapter 11, we have

o=

DT*(x)B

= d(T*(X), B) + T*(X)

...J dB,

so that
dfx = -T*(X) ...J dB.

(3.8)

For reasons which will become clear later on, the function fx is sometimes called
the momentum function associated to the vector field X.
4. THE FUNDAMENTAL EXTERIOR TWO-FORM ON T*(M)

It turns out that the exterior two-form
D

= dB

(4.1)

plays a fundamental role in mechanics, and we therefore study some of its
properties. First of all, since d 2 = 0, we have
dD=

o.

(4.2)

We claim that Dz is'a nonsingular bilinear form on Tz(T*(M») for each
z E T*(M). That is,
if

then

13.4

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

For this purpose we compute the local expression for n in terms of a chart
(U), T*(a) [where Z E 7r- I (U)]. The map T*(a) gives a diffeomorphism
of 7r- I (U) with a subset of V E9 V*, and by (3.4) the form (J on M carries over
to the corresponding form (Ja on V E9 V* = T*(V). Also, (Ja can be regarded as
a (V* E9 V)-valued function which is given by (3.2). Let us denote h*(a) by ~a,
and let
~a = -<Xl> X 2 > E V E9 V*
(7r- I

be considered a constant vector field on V E9 V*. Then
(~a, (Ja)<u!.u;>

and so

d(~a,

=

(X I,

u;),

(Ja) is the linear differential form given by

On the other hand, since ~a is a constant vector field, the Lie derivative DEa(Ja
reduces to the ordinary derivative of the linear function -< U2,
> ~ -<
0> .
This derivative is just the constant -<X 2 , 0>. Thus the Lie derivative DEa(Ja
is given by the constant linear form

u;

D~a(Ja

=

u;,

-<X 2 ,0> E V* E9 V;

that is,
(Tla, DEa(Ja) = (Y l> X 2).

Now ~a..J na = ~a..J d(Ja = DEa(Ja - d(~a, (Ja), so we see that ~a..J na is the
constant form
~a..J (lfJ = -<X 2 ,-X 1 > E V* E9 V.
To recapitulate, if ~ E Tz(T*(M)
-<Xl> X 2 > E V E9 V*, then
(~ ..J nz)T*(a) =

is such that h*(a) is given by h*(a) =

-< X 2, -X 1>

E V*

E9 V.

(4.4)

Equation (4.3) clearly follows from this.
Since (4.3) is of fundamental importance, we present an alternative derivation for the case of a finite-dimensional manifold. If we use the coordinates

Thus (X ..J n)z = 0 if and only if Xz = O. This shows that on T*(M) we
have a one-to-one correspondence, X ~ X ..J n, between vector fields and

linear differential forms.
so that

519

Let us denote by Wx the form corresponding to X,

Wx = X ..In;
and let us denote by X w the vector field corresponding to the linear differential
form w. Thus
w = Xw ..J n = Wx.,.
Observe that
if and only if
dw= 0
Dx.,n = O.
(4.7)
In fact, by (4.2),

Dx.,n = d(Xw..J n) = dw.
In particular, there is a distinguished class of ve~tor fields on T*(M)-those
corresponding to functions, i.e., the vector fields of the form X dF , where F is a
function on T*(M). These vector fields are called Hamiltonian vector fields.
*In view of (4.6), if Dxn = 0, then locally, at least, X is of the form XdF,
since any form w with dw = 0 can be written locally as w = dF. If we make the
topological assumption that T*(M) has vanishing first cohomology group, then
Dxn = 0 is equivalent to X being Hamiltonian. This assumption is really a
restriction on the nature of the configuration space M. Since we do not wish to
restrict M in this manner, we will not take Dxn = 0 as the definition of a
Hamiltonian vector field.*
Note that if X and Yare Hamiltonian vector fields, so is aX
and b are constants. In fact, if X = X dF and Y = XdG, then

aX

+ bY =

+ bY, where a

Xd(aF+bG)'

Furthermore, [X, Y] is also a Hamiltonian vector field. In fact,

Dx(Y..J n) = Dx Y ..J n
= DxY..Jn,

+ Y ..J Dxn

since Dxn = O. Since Dx Y = [X, Y], we see that

[X, Y] ..J n = Dx dG

= dDxG.

In other words, we have
(4.8)
We thus see that we have a binary operation on functions corresponding to the
Lie bracket on Hamiltonian vector fields. It is called the Poisson b1'acket and is
denoted by {F, G}. In other words, we define

so that we can rewrite (4.8) as

Proposition 4.1. If F and G are functions on T*(M) such that

then
In other words, if G is constant along the solution curves of X dF , then F is
constant along the solution curves of X dG .
In fact,

XdFG = {F, G} = -{G, F} = -XdGF.
It will turn out that Proposition 4.1 is the prototype of all the "conservation
laws" of mechanics.
We close this section with the following observation. Let Y be a vector
field on M. Then the momentum function of Y is a function jy on T*(M).
Equation (3.8) asserts that
(4.14)
-T*(Y) = X dfy '
5. HAMILTONIAN MECHANICS

As we indicated in the introduction, the first fundamental assumption of mechanics is that the evolution of the system is determined by a flow on T*(M),
where M is the configuration space of the system. The second fundamental
assumption concerns the character of the flow. It is assumed that the infinitesimal generator of the flow is a Hamiltonian vector field. That is, it is assumed
that there is a function H (called the energy) on T*(M) such that the vector
field X-dH is the infinitesimal generator of the flow on T*(M) describing the

13.5

HAMILTONIAN MECHANICS

521

evolution of the system. (The minus sign is a consequence of certain standard
conventions.) In order to see what this means, let us express the equations of
motion in terms of q- and p-coordinates for a finite-dimensional system. Thus
X -dH =

oH 0

L: ( opi oqi -

oH 0)

oqi opi .

Thus, if -<ql(-), . .. , qn(.), pl(-), ... , pn(-)>- is an integral curve of the flow,
it must satisfy the differential equations
dqi

oH

de

opi

and

(5.1)

A trivial consequence of (4.11) is that
X_dHH

= O.

In other words, the function H is constant along trajectories of the system.
This principle is known as the law of conservation of energy.
More generally, we can formulate Proposition 4.1 as:
Proposition 5.1. Let X -dH be the infinitesimal generator of a mechanical
system with energy H. Let F be a function such that
XdFH

= O.

Then F is constant on the trajectories, i.e., solution curves, of the flow
generated by X-dH.
Proposition 5.1 is the prototype of all the "momentum conservation" laws
we shall derive later; see, for example, the discussion at the beginning of Section 6.
In order to specify the mechanical system, one must give the function H.
It turns out (in many but not all cases) that the energy is the sum of two terms,
H = K
U, where K is called the kinetic energy and U is called the potential
energy. They each have a very special form which we now describe.
The kinetic energy is a function on T*(M) which is associated with a
Riemann metric on M. Let ( , ) be a Riemann metric on M. It gives a scalar
product ( , )x on each Tx(M), and therefore induces an isomorphism of TiM)
with T:(M), and thus gives a scalar product on T:(M) which we will continue
to denote by ( , ). The function K is then defined by

+

K(l)

=

tel, l).

(5.2)

To understand the relevance of a Riemann metric to mechanics, let us consider the
most elementary case - the study of a single particle of mass m in lEa. The usual relation
between velocity and momentum,

p=mq
can be formulated as follows: Consider the Riemann metric on 1E3 which is
m X the Euclidean metric. That is, if -< x, y, z>- are rectangular coordinates on

522

13.5

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

1E3 and
then

-< qx, qy, qZ1 qx, qy, qz>-

are the corresponding coordinates on T(1E3),

where
(5.3)

and
(5.4)
Thus the passage from velocity to momentum depends on the choice of a
Riemann metric, which determines a map from T(JJ1) --> T*(JJ1). This can be
regarded as a generalized "choice of mass" for the configuration.
The function U is assumed to be of the form U = U 0 7[", where U is a
function on JJ1. The form F = - dU is called the force field whose potential is U.
I t can be regarded as a vector field on JJ1 in view of the Riemann metric on JJ1:
for any

~ E

Tx(JJ1).

In the special case of a single particle in 1E3 with mass m, substituting (5.3)
and (5.4) into Eq. (5.1) gives, when we write H = K

and

(5.5)

or, since m is constant,

Returning to the general theory, we now formulate a useful corollary of
Proposition 5.1.

Proposition 5.2. Let H = K
U be the energy associated with the
Riemann metric ( , ) and the function U on JJ1. Let Y be a vector field on

6. THE CENTRAL.FORCE PROBLEM

Before proceeding with the general theory, we illustrate the previous results in
a simple but important case. We will study the motion of a particle in 1E3 acted
on by a "force centered at the origin". That is, our configuration space M will
be taken to be 1E3 - {O}, and the Riemann metric is m X the Euclidean metric,
where m is the "mass" of the particle. We also assume that the function D
depends only on the distance to the origin. Thus D(x, y, z) = P(r), where
r2 = x 2
y2
Z2.
Under these circumstances it is clear that any rotation
about the origin is an isometry of the Riemann metric and preserves D. We
can therefore apply Proposition 5.2 to the infinitesimal rotations x(al ay) y(alax) to conclude that the corresponding momentum function XPy - yp", is
constant. (This momentum function is known as the angular momentum about
the z-axis.) Similarly, the functions Xpz - zp", and YPz - Zpy must be constant
on any trajectory of the flow. If we write x = -< x, y, z>- and p = -< p"" Py, pz>- ,
then these three conservation laws can be combined to read

+ +

x A p

= const,

(6.1)

which is known as the law of conservation of angular momentum. Here x and p
are considered vector-valued functions on T*(M). In order to study the implications of (6.1), let us first distinguish two cases: where the constant rE 0 and
where the constant vanishes. If the constant occurring in (6.1) does not vanish,
then (6.1) implies that the plane spanned by x and p does not change. In
particular, the motion is such that x lies in a fixed plane. If x A p = 0, we
argue as follows:
Since p = mx, we have x A x = o. Since x rE 0, this implies that

x=
for some function

Xof time.

Now

:t Ilxll = II!II (x,

Ilxll = (x, x) 1/2, so

and therefore

so that

x/llxli

= const; that is,

x lies on a fixed ray through the origin.

If we differentiate (6.2) and make use of the fact that

x/llxll is constant, we

that is,
(6.3)
where r = Ilxll.
In any event, in all cases the particle x moves in a plane. We may therefore
restrict our attention to the plane. That is, we can consider a "new" mechanical
system where M = 1E2 - {O} and its Riemann metric, the function V = Per),
etc. Let us introduce polar "coordinates" in the plane. Then a/ao preserves the
metric and the potential. If -< r, 0, p" po>- are the corresponding coordinates
on T*(M), then Proposition 5.2 implies that
(6.4)

Po = const.

(Note that this is really just that part of (6.1) that we haven't yet used.) Now
in terms of polar coordinates, the Euclidean metric has the form of Eq. (8.7)
of Chapter 9, so that the Riemann metric associated to the mass m which is
m X the Euclidean metric is given by

II (r, 8) 112 =

m{r2

+ r 282}.

In particular, the associated map from T(M) to T*(M) is given by
Pr

=

and

mr

(6.5)

Thus (6.4) says that
(6.4')
To understand the significance of (6.4'), consider a curve x(·) in the plane.
Consider the region 'U bounded by the portion of the ray from 0 to x(O), the
portion of the ray from 0 to x(t), and the curve x(·) from 0 to t. (See Fig. 13.1.)
Then

~1 r2 dO =

Fig. 13.1

Thus (6.4') is exactly the content of Kepler's second law: The particle sweeps
out area at a constant rate.
Thus we have seen that the spherical symmetry of the system implies that
the motion is in a plane and that Kepler's second law holds.

present context reads

We can now use the following procedure for solving the equations of motio~:
First, for a given angular momentum find the various solution curves r(·) of (6.7).
For a solution r(·), determine 8(·) by integrating = A/mr 2 to get

e

t

8(t) =

lto( mr~( s) ds + const.

(6.9)

We can obtain a good bit of information about the nature of the solutions
of (6.7) by using the law of conservation of energy. We draw a graph of the
function, as shown in Fig. 13.2. Suppose that the trajectory r(·) has the constant energy El = tmr2 Q(r). Then if the set {r : Q(r) ~ E 1} is bounded,
r(t) must always be in this set, since tmr2 ~ o. In fact, suppose that the
interval a ~ r ~ b is such that Q(a) = Q(b) = El and Q(b E) > El and
Q(a - E) > E 1 for small E. Then if a ~ r(t o) ~ b for some value of to, it follows

+

+

526

13.6

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

that a ~ r(t) ~ b for all t. Furthermore, if Q(r) < E 1 for a < r < b, then for
a < r(t o) < b, r(t) cannot vanish. The particle is thus moving to one of the
limits r = a and r = b. If we use the law of conservation of energy, we see that
~mf2

+ Q(r) =

Et,

so that

dr
dt

= r= ±

lEI - Q(r) .

\I!m

For a < r < b we see that r is a monotone function of t, and we can solve to
obtain t as a function of r by the formula

t(r) = ±<!m)1/2

if

r(t o) = roo

(6.10)

In particular, if Q'(a) ~ 0 and Q'(b) ~ 0, the integral in (6.10) converges, so
that it takes a finite amount of time for r to get to a or to b. Thus (since
dr/dt = Q'(r) ~ 0), the function r oscillates between a and b taking the time

to get from one side to the other.
If {r: Q(r) ~ E 2} is not bounded, then the motion with energy E2 need
not be bounded. For instance, suppose that Q(r) < E2 for r > a. Then if
r(t o) > a and r(t o) < 0, T will decrease until it hits a at which time it will turn
around and then go off to infinity; if f(to) > 0, then r will simply go to infinity.
The trajectory in this case is that of r coming in from infinity, turning around
at a, and then going back to infinity.
We recall that this is a descriptive analysis of the function r(·). The curve
8(·) is then to be determined by (6.9).
Frequently we are interested in the tajectories as curves in the r8-plane
without reference to the time dependence. Suppose that the energy is E and the
angular momentum is A. For the range where r ~ 0 we can substitute

interior of the ellipse is swept out at the uniform rate A/2m. Thus the area,

7. THE TWO-BODY PROBLEM

Let us consider the mechanical system consisting of n particles each having
mass mi, so that the configuration space is 1E3 X ... X 1E3 (n times), and if
a = -<a I, ... , an> EM, where a l = -<xl, yI, ZI> E 1E 3 , then

!lldl1 2

=
=

!mllld I l1 2 + ... + !mnlld nl1 2
!mI[(x I)2 + U/)2 + (ZI)2] + ... + !mn[(xn)2 + (yn)2 + (zn)2]

is the kinetic energy of the system. As we indicated in Section 1, we may wish
to restrict the manifold M to be that subset of 1E3 X ... X 1E3 for which no
ai = aj for any i '1'" J. Let us further assume that the potential energy depends
only on the mutual distances between the particles. That is, let us assume that

U(ar, ... ,an) = P(lla2 -

alii, Ilaj - alii, ... , Ilan - an-III).

Then if A is a Euclidean motion of 1E3 and we apply A simultaneously to all the
particles, the kinetic and potential energy are conserved. That is, the transformation
is an isometry of the Riemann metric on M and preserves U.
Let -<xl, yI, zr, ... ,xn, yn, zn> be the Cartesian coordinates on M,
and let
be the eorresponding coordinates on T*(M). Now a/ax is the vector field
representing the infinitesimal translation in the x-direction in 1E3. Therefore,

a

-<xl, yr, zr, x 2, ... ,x n, yn, zn>
1--+

-<Xl + t, yr, zr, x 2 + t, y2, Z2, ... ,xn + t, yn, zn>.

We can therefore apply Proposition 5.2 to conclude that the function
Px1

+ Px2 + ... + pxn

is constant in any trajectory. This function is known as the total linear momentum in the x-direction. Similarly, the total linear momentum in the y-direction,
Pyl

+ ... + pyn,

and the total linear momentum in the z-direction,
Pzl

+ ... + pzn,

must be conserved. If we define pi E 1E3 by setting pi

= -< Pxt, Pyt, Pzt> , then

13.7

THE TWO-BODY PROBLEM

529

we can say that the 1E 3-valued funct~on
pl+p2+ ... +pn

must be conserved. This is the law of conservation of total linear momentum.
(For two particles the assertion that PI + P2 is conserved is just Newton's law
of "equality of action and reaction". In our setup we see that this law is a
reflection of the invariance of the physical situation under translations.)
The vector field x(ajay) - y(ajax) represents infinitesimal rotation about
the z-axis in 1E3. Therefore,
la

2a
2a
X ayl_- y ax 1 + x ay2 - y ax2

represents simultaneous infinitesimal rotation of all the particles about the z-axis.
Therefore, the function
q",lPyl - qylP",l

+ ... + qxnpyn -

qynp",n

is conserved. This is the law of conservation of total angular momentum about
the z-axis. Similarly, we obtain the law of conservation of total angular momentum about the x- and y-axes. If we set
qi =

-< qxl, qyl, qzj>-

E 1E 3 ,

we can combine the three equations by saying that the function
ql 1\ pI

+ ... + qn

1\ pn

with values in 1\2(1E3) is constant on the trajectdries of the motion.
Let us examine more closely the law of conservation of total linear momentum. In view of the fact that

etc., we have pi = mi(daijdt), and thus
d (
1
dt
mla

+ m2a 2 + ... + mnan) =

const.

/'

In other words, the center of mass

C = ml a1
ml

+ ... + mnan
+ ... + m,n

moves in a straight line with constant velocity.
Suppose there are only two particles. Then it is reasonable to introduce the
center of mass
C = ml a 1 + m2 a 2
ml + m2
and the relative position vector

530

13.8

as new coordinates. If we solve for a land a 2 , we get

and therefore the kinetic energy is given by
K(C, d) =

-2

m~2m2

ml

IIdl1 2

+ !(ml + m2)IICI1 2,

while U(C, d) = P(lldll).
Thus the motions of the system have the following description: The center
of mass has constant linear motion, and the relative position vector d = a 1 - a 2
satisfies the equations of motion of a single particle with mass
mlm2
ml
m2

+

in the central-force field with potential U = P(lldll). We can thus apply the
results of the preceding section to determine the motions of the particle. In
particular, if P(lldll) = a/lldll is the inverse-square potential, the corresponding
two-body problems can be completely solved.
Note that if m2 is very large compared to mb then C is very close to a 2.
In this case d(·) is a good approximation to the motion of the smaller particle
relative to the larger one.
This is the situation that arises, for example, in the study of the motion of
of the planets relative to the sun.
8. LAGRANGE'S EQUATIONS

Our discussion of mechanics has led us to a certain kind of vector field X on
T*(M), where M is the configuration manifold. In the case where H = K
U,
the Riemann metric giving K induces an isomorphism .c [that is, a diffeomorphism which is linear on each Tx(lI1)] from T(M) to T*(M). We therefore
obtain a vector field Y on T(M) such that .c*Yv = X,c(V) at any v E T(M).
We can therefore inquire about the form of this vector field Y in terms of local
coordinates <ql, ... , qn, ql, ... ,qn»- on T(M), associated with coordinates
<Xl, ... ,xn»- on M. Suppose that the Riemann metric is given by

+

II(qi, ... , qn)1I2

=

L Oii(qi, ... ,qn)(iqj.

If <qi, ... , qn, pi, ... ,pn»- are corresponding local coordinates on T*(M),
then the diffeomorphism .c is given by

(8.1)

We could proceed to use (8.1) to obtain the local expression for .c and thereby
the local expression for Y. However, it is more convenient to argue a little
differently. Let L be the function on T(M) defined by

that is,

531

L= K- U,

where K(v) = !llvl1 2and U(v) = D(7I"(v» are the kinetic and potential energy
expressed as functions on T(M). We can rewrite (8.1) as
i
aL
p = aqi'

(8.3)

Then for any l E T*(M), we have
H(l) = (Jr1(l), l) - L(£-l(l».

(8.4)

In fact, by definition,
(£-l(l), l) =

IIll12 = 1I£-1(l)11 2,

so that
(£-1(l), l) - L(£-l(l»

=

IIll12 - !llll12 + D(7I"(l»

= !llll12 + U(l)
= H(l).

In terms of local coordinates we can write (8.4) as

H(q1, ... ,qn, pI, ... ,pn) =

L

p'qi - L(qt, ... , qn, qt, ... , qn),

where the qi are regarded as functions of the q's and p's via

13.9

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

on T(1I1). The first of Eqs. (8.7) says that we are dealing with a system of secondorder differential equations which is given implicitly by the second of Eqs. (8.7).
Equations (8.7) are known as Lagrange's equations.
For certain purposes Lagrange's equations are very convenient. We illustrate by establishing the "principle of mechanical similarity". Note that
Eqs. (8.7) are unchanged if we replace L by cL, where c is any nonzero constant.
Suppose that 111 is an open subset of a vector space with linear coordinates
Xl, •.• , xn and that the Riemann metric is given by 2: Yij(/r/, where the Yij are
constant. Let ma denote the linear map consisting of multiplication by a > 0,
that is, ma(x \ ... , xn) = -< ax \ ... , axn>-. Suppose that U is a homogeneous
function of degree p, so that
U(ax1, ... , axn)

=

aPU(x1, ... , xn).

Now let us change our time scale by a factor (3, replacing t by s = (3t. Then

In other words, replacing qi by aqi and t by (3t carries solutions into solution:
if we change the linear scale by a and change the time scale by a 1 - ( / 2)p, we
obtain an isomorphic situation. For instance, if U is homogeneous of degree -1
(as in the case of an inverse-square law of attraction), then (3 = a 3/2 • In particular, the period of any periodic orbit is proportional to the ~-power of its
linear dimension, which is just Kepler's third law. We thus see that Kepler's
third law is an exact consequence of the inverse-square law of attraction.
Returning to the study of the general Lagrangian system, we observe again
that it is a system of second-order differential equations. We can therefore
apply the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem to it to conclude that
jor every x E 111 and jor every t E Tx(1I1) there is a unique curve CO which is a
trajectory oj the system and jor which C(O) = x and C'(O) = t.
9. VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLES

The function L plays a crucial role in the study of variational principles of
mechanics. Consider the following problem: Let p and q be two points of M,
and let t1 < t2 be two real numbers. For any differentiable curve C defined on

Note that C'(t) E T(M) and L is a function on T(M), so the integrand makes
sense. Among all curves joining p to q, find that curve for which I[C] takes on
its minimum value. We shall see t.hat a necessary condition for I[C] to be a
minimum is that it be a trajectory of a mechanical system. (In fact, if a suitable
notion of neighborhood is introduced on the space of curves, it is also a necessary
condition for C to be even a local minimum.)
Before establishing this result, it is convenient to have another expression
for I[C]. As before, let .c be the map of T(M) -+ T*(M) given by the Riemann
metric. Let'C be the curve in T*(M) given by

'C(t) = .c(C'(t»).
Then

The question of when this necessary condition is also sufficient is a more
complicated one. We shall not discuss it in any generality here, but refer the
reader to any standard source on the calculus of variations.

Fig. 13.3

By the way, we can derive a bonus from (9.5). Suppose that we consider
the following problem: Let N 1 and N 2 be two submanifolds (Fig. 13.3) of M,
and suppose that we require that C minimize I among all curves joining N 1 to N 2
and not merely among those joining p to q. In this case (9.5) will have to vanish
for all vector fields Z which are tangent to N 1 at p and to N 2 at q. Now observe

536

13.9

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

that if G is a solution to this minimum problem, it certainly is a solution to the
problem of minimizing I among all curves joining p to q. In particular, G must
be a trajectory of the mechanical system. As the reader can easily check, this
implies that
z ..J (J - (D-zH) (C(t)) dt = 0

for all vector fields Z. Thus, if G solves the more difficult minimization problem,

and
Since if p '=/= q we can choose Zp arbitrarily in T peN 1) and Zq arbitrarily in

In other words, the curve G must be orthogonal to the submanifolds N 1 and N 2.
Although our statement of Proposition 9.1 was couched in the framework of
dynamical systems, it actually can be formulated in a more general context.
Let L be any function on T(M)-not necessarily of the type K - U. We can
then define the integral I as in (9.1) and again pose the minimization problem.
This is the typical problem in the calculus of variations. We have already
discusse<\ this problem from a different point of view in Section 3.15. We leave
to the reader the task of showing that our arguments carryover in this more
general case if the matrix

GEODESIC COORDINATES

10. GEODESIC COORDINATES

In this section we depart momentarily from the study of mechanics in order to
exhibit some applications of the results of the preceding paragraphs to the
study of Riemann manifolds. Note that a Riemann manifold always defines a
mechanical system by its kinetic energy if we set the potential energy equal to
zero. It is this special kind of mechanical system that we wish to study in this
section.
Let M be a finite-dimensional manifold with a Riemann metric and, as
above, define L on T(M) by setting
L(v) =

illvl1 2 •

This then determines a vector field Yon T(M) which corresponds to the system
of differential equations (8.7) in terms of local coordinates. Let p be a point of M.
For every ~ E Tp(M) there is a unique trajectory CEO such that
q(O) = ~.

In terms of local coordinates, if ~
CE(t) =

where

~n >- , then

-< ql(t), ..• , qf(t) >-,

qi are the unique solutions of the differential equations
dq~

with the initial conditions
qE(O)

=

xi(p),

qi

By the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem the functions
are
defined for sufficiently small t. We can regard CE(t) as dependent on both ~ and t.
In other words, we have a map C.O assigning to each ~ E Tp(M) and each
sufficiently small t a point of M. The map C.(·) is, in fact, defined in some
neighborhood of T p(M) X {O} C T p(M) X IR.
The above is true for any Lagrangian function. In the case of no potential
energy we can say a lot more. Let s be a real number. Consider the curve
CE(s .), that is,
CE(st) = -<ql(st), ... , qf(st) >-.
Then (suppressing the subscript
computations)

~

In other words,

Thus the curve

is again a trajectory of the system, and we clearly have

CHs ·)10 = sC~(-)lo = s~.
By the uniqueness theorem for differential equations we thus must have
C~(st) = C.~(t).

(l0.1)

We are therefore led to define a map, which we shall call exp, from
Tp(M) - 7 M by setting
(10.2)
exp (~) = C~(l).
Note that the map exp is defined and differentiable in some neighborhood of
the origin in Tp(M). In fact, by (10.1),
exp

W

=

C~mll(11 ~II),

where now UII ~lllies on the unit sphere in T p(M) [the unit sphere with respect
to the Euclidean metric given by the scalar product on Tp(M)J. Since the unit
sphere is compact, there is some f > 0 such that C~(t) is defined for all 'T/ on the
unit sphere and all It I < f. Thus exp will be defined for all II ~II < f.
The map exp is a differentiable map from some neighborhood of the origin
in the vector space T p(M) into the manifold. Let us compute
exp*o: To[Tp(M)J

-7

Tp(M).

Let ~ E Tp(M), and let us consider the straight line through 0, l~, in Tp(M)
given by l~(t) = t~. Since Tp(M) is a vector space, we can identify To[Tp(M)]
with Tp(M) via the identity chart, in which case we identify
l~(O)

with

~.

But
exp

(10.3)

GEODESIC COORDINATES

and the tangent to this curve at 0 is

just~.

539

In other words,

exp*o [l[(O)] = ~.
Thus, if we identify To[Tp(M)] with Tp(M), we can assert that
exp*o: To[Tp(M)]

~

Tp(M)

is given by
(10.4)

In particular, the map exp*o is nonsingular, so that by the implicit-function
theorem the map exp is a diffeomorphism in some neighborhood of the origin.
We have thus constructed a diffeomorphism exp from some neighborhood
of the origin in T p(M) into M, which by (10.3) carries straight lines through the
origin into trajectories through p. In the case of no potential energy the trajectories are called geodesics for reasons which will soon become apparent. If we
identify T p(M) with V by some chart (U, ex), we can then use exp to introduce
a new chart (U', na) by setting
n;;1(~a) = exp

W.

The chart n" has the property that n,,(p) = 0 and na carries geodesics through p
into straight lines through the origin. The chart (U', na) is called a geodesic
normal chart, and corresponding coordinates are called geodesic normal coordinates
onM.
Let us consider the curve C~O = exp (. ~) which is defined for 0 ~ t ~ 1
so long as II ~II < E. We have

I[C~(·)]

=

f01 L(q(t)) dt = ! 101IICHt) 112 dt.

But, by the conservation of energy, for any trajectory of our system we have
H 0 £(C'(t)) = const. In this case, since U = 0, H 0 £(C'(t)) = L(C'(t)) =
!IICHt)11 2= const. Since CE(O) = ~,we have IIC~(t) II = II ~II, and therefore

(7], CW») = 0 for any fJ wpich is tangent to exp Sliell, where SlItll is the sphere
of radius II~II in Tp(M). (See Fig. 13.4.) In other words, not only are the rays
through the origin orthogonal to the spheres in the Euclidean metric of Tp(M),
but also the image of a ray through the origin under exp is orthogonal to the
image of a sphere about p in the Riemann metric of M.
In particular, we can transfer "polar coordinates" on Tp(M) to M so as to
get "geodesic polar coordinates" on M. This has the following effect: Let r be
the "radial coordinate", that is, r is the function defined in U by

suppose that r E Tx(M), where x = exp ~ for some ~ E Tp(M). Then we can
write r = rl + r2, where rl is some multiple of CW) and r2 is tangent to
exp SII~II. By the above result, (rI, r2) = 0, so
IIrl1 2 = IIrll1 2 + IIr211 2
and we obtain (10.6), with equality holding only if IIr211 = O.
We are now in the same fortunate position we were in Section 9 of Chapter 9.

In short,

Theorem 10.1. Let E > be so small that the map exp is a diffeomorphism
onB. = HE Tp(M) : II~II < E}. Let x = exp ~ be a point of U = exp B •.
Then the geodesic C~ joining p to x has length II ~II, and any other curve D
joining p to x is strictly longer unless D differs from C~ only in a (monotone)
change of parameter. In other words, loosely speaking, geodesics are locally
the shortest curves joining two points.

Since we have come this far, let us show in addition that geodesics also
locally minimize the energy. Let D be any curve from [0,1] to M. Then by
Schwarz's inequality we have

Now equality holds in the second inequality only if D'(t) is proportional to C'(t),
while equality holds in the first only if IID'(t) II = const. We thus conclude that
IID'(t)1I = II~II, that is, D'(t) = C'(t). In short, we have proved:
Proposition 10.1. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 10.1 the curve C~(-)
is a strict absolute minimum for I[C] among all curves C: [0,1] -+ M such
that C(O) = p and C(l) = x.

11. EULER'S EQUATIONS

Under certain circumstances, which we shall presently describe, the equations of
motion take a particularly elegant form. The first special assumption that we
shall make is that there is an isomorphism of T(M) with M X V. More precisely,
we assume that there is a diffeomorphism, £, of T(M) with ltf X V such that
£(~) = <.m, v> I where m = 'Ira), and for each x EM the map .~ t-+ v of
T:.:(M) -+ V is a linear isomorphism of vector spaces. For example, if M is an
open subset of V, then the identity chart defines such an isomorphism
£(~)

= <''Ir(~), ~id>.

A slightly less trivial example is furnished by the n-dimensional torus Tn =
8 1 X ... X 8 1• Then we can introduce "angular variables" 01, ... , On, where
0' is the angular variable on the ith circle. We thus obtain n vector fields
a/ao 1, ••• ,aiM'" which are linearly independent at each point of ltf. We have a
basis of T:.:(M) and therefore an isomorphism of T:.:(M) with an = V which

542

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

13.11

defines the desired map L. We shall encounter a more complicated example in
the next section. We should point out that only very special kinds of manifolds
admit such an isomorphism L of T(M) with M X V.
For the rest of this section we shall identify T(M') with M X V and T*(M)
with M X V* via the corresponding (adjoint) isomorphism.
The rule which identifies each T",(M) with V can be regarded as a V-valued
linear differential form on M. Let us denote this form by w. In other words,
the identification L is given by L(O = (~, w",) if ~ E TAM). We can therefore
study the V-valued exterior two-form dw. For each pair of tangent. vectors
~, 7] E T",(M) we obtain (7], ~ ..J dw) as an element of V. Now we can identify ~
and 7] with vectors of V. We thus obtain a V-valued antisymmetric bilinear form
on V; if we call it a"" we have
a",(v, w) = (7], ~..J dw),

where (~, w",) = v, (7], w",) = w, and ~, 7] E T",(M). Note that, in general, the
bilinear form a", depends on x. Our second fundamental assumption about the
identification L is that a", is independent of x. That is, we assume that there is a
V-valued bilinear form a such that
(Y, X ..J dw) = a(X, w), (Y, w»)

(11.1)

for all vector fields X and Y on M.
In the examples given above (the open subset of Von the torus) dw = 0,
so that (11.1) holds trivially. In the next section we shall come across a case
where dw ~ O.
To understand (11.1) a little better, let us introduce the following notation:
For any v E V let (j be the vector field on M given by «(j,-w)", = v for all x E M.
Then for any v, wE V, we have

('11;, (j ..J dw)

= D,,(11;, w) - Dw«(j, w) - ([(j, 11;], w).

Now (11;, w) = wand «(j, w) = v are constants, so the first two terms on the right
disappear. Thus we can rewrite (11.1) as
a(v, w) = -([(j, 11;], w).

(ILl')

For the kinetic energy of a mechanical system we need a Riemann metric
on M. A Riemann metric on M gives a scalar product on each T",(M). This
means giving a scalar product ( , )", on V for each x E M. Our third special
assumption is that ( , )", does not depend on x. Thus we are given a scalar
product on V which gives the Riemann metric on M via the identification of
T(M) with M X V.
We wish to describe the vector field on T*(M) as X'-dH, where H = K
U,
K being the kinetic energy'of the Riemann metric and U being some potential
energy. Since T*(M) = M X V*, a vector field X on T*(M) can be uniquely
written as X = Xl
X 2 , where Xl is t!1ngent to M and X 2 is tangent to V*.
Furthermore, we can regard Xl as a V-valued function and X 2 as a V*-valued

12. RIGID-BODY MOTION

We shall apply the results of the previous section to the study of the motion of
a rigid body. For simplicity, we shall confine ourselves to the study of the
motion of a rigid body with one point fixed. The more general case where the
body as a whole is allowed to move can be handled by similar methods. (Frequently, by considering first the motion of the center of gravity, the more
general case can be split into two parts: the motion of the center of gravity and
the motion of the body relative to the center of gravity. This then reduces the
problem to the one we are studying.)
In order to exhibit the generality of our method, we shall consider the
equations of motion of a rigid body in P. Only at the end will we make use of
the fact that n = 3. Let us fix some positive orthonormal system "drawn through
the fixed point of the body". In other words, we fix some initial position Xo =
-< b 1, ••• , bn >- of the body. Any other position, Xl, of the body can be obtained
from Xo by a rotation: Xl = RlXo. Let R(t) = eAt be a one-parameter group
of rotations. Then
is a curve of possible positions of the body. The tangent to this curve at X 1 will
be denoted by Ax!.
Thus Ax!
E Tx!(M). If X2 = R2XO = R2Rl-1 RlXO =
R2RllXb then AX2 is the tangent to the curve R2R(t)xo = R2R~lRlR(t)xo,
so that AX2 = (R2RllhAxl' It is clear from its definition that AX! = 0 if and
only if A = O.
We can regard the map A ~ AX! as a map from the space of skew adjoint
linear transformations to Tx)(M). Let V denote the space.of skew adjoint linear
transformations. Then since
d'lm=lm
V
d' M = n(n 2- 1)
and the map A ~ AX) is an injection, we conclude that it is an isomorphism.
We thus have a trivialization T(M) ~ M X V. Consequently, we get a Vvalued linear differential form w, as in Section 11.
Let us describe once more the meaning of wx: Tx(M) ~ V. If ~ E TAM)
represents an infinitesimal motion of the body, then since the body is rigid, we
can regard ~ as an infinitesimal rotation of the body relative to an observer
situated outside the body (fixed in space). Thus ~ = B for some B E V, say.
Then <~, w) is the corresponding infinitesimal rotation expressed in terms of
the basis attached to the body; that is, <~, w) = R~IBRI if X = RIXo .
. We denote by A the vector field X ~ Ax corresponding to A E V. Let CPt
be the one-parameter group generated by !J for some BE V. Note that at any
X2 = R2XO we have cP
X2 = R2eBtxO' Then at any Xl = RlXO we have

(12.1)

We now show how a mass distribution on the body determines a Riemann metric
on M. Let p be a particle on the body with mass m. We will assume that the
particle p has coordinates <. pI, ... , pn> relative to the axes drawn on the
body. Suppose that the body is at position x = <. b1 , ••• , bn >. Then the
particle p will be situated at the point p Ib 1 + ... + pnb n E P. If R(t) = eAt
is a one-parameter group of rotations, then when the body is at R1R(t)x the
particle p will be situate~_ at
Rl[plR(t)b 1

+ ... + pnR(t)b n] =

RIR(t)p.

Thus the velocity of the particle p as the body undergoes the motion generated
by A is R1Ap, and the kinetic energy of the particle p is -lml/R 1Api/2 =
!mIIApI/2, since Rl is an orthogonal linear transformation. We define the kinetic
energy of Ax to be the total kinetic energy of all the particles of the body. Thus

Note that I/Axll depends only on A, so that our third requirement of the last
section is satisfied, provided (12.2) does indeed define a norm on V. (Note: That
the mass distribution could be such that Ap = 0 for all p in {p : m(p) > O}
does not imply that A = O. For example, suppose that all the mass were concentrated along a line l. If A represents infinitesimal rotation about l, so that
Ap = 0 for pEl, then I/AI/ = O. However, it is clear that if the set of p for
which m > 0 spans P, then (12.2) defines a Riemann metric. In fact,

for all p belonging to a spanning set, and thus A = 0.)
Let us examine the scalar product given in (12.2) a little more closely. Let f

f(al

In other words, A = const. The motion of the body consists of a steady rotation
about some axis fixed on the body. Of course, this means that for an observer
in space also, the body undergoes a steady rotation about a fixed axis.
Next, let us consider the case of an axially symmetric rigid body moving

Thus for an observer situated on the body the instantaneous axis of rotation
describes a circle around the axis of symmetry of the body. This motion is
known as regular precession. (This motion should not be confused with the astronomical precession of the earth's axis, which is due to the gravitational action
of the sun and moon.)
If no two of II, 1 2 , and I a are equal, then the equations of motion can still
be solved in terms of integrals, although the expression is rather complicated.
We refer the reader to any standard book on mechanics for the details.
So far we have been considering the motion with no potential. If V rf 0,
then Eqs. (12.4) are usually not so easy to solve. Let us treat the case of a
symmetrical top; that is, II = 12 and U is given by the gravitational potential.
In order to solve this problem it is convenient to use the Euler angles of astronomy as the local coordinates on M. In order to avoid confusion, we reproduce
the definitions here: We let ~x, ~y, ~z be the basis vectors of lEa corresponding to
the rectangular coordinates x, y, z, where we take the origin of lEa to be the fixed
point of the body. We may assume that the center of mass of the body is distinct
from the fixed point-otherwise there will be no gravitational force acting on
the body. It is easy to see that the center of mass C lies on the axis of symmetry.
We shall assume that the vectors drawn on the body are such that ba points in
the direction from the fixed point to the center of mass, i.e., from 0 to c. Then

Furthermore, since (8., n) = 0, the projection of 8. onto the plane spanned by

to the height of the center of gravity if we assume (as we shall) a uniformly

Thus, just as in our treatment of the central-force problem, for a fixed
value of Pa/a", and Pa/a"" the motion of 8 is determined by a one-dimensional
mechanical system whose energy is given by (12.9). After solving this mechanical system for 8, we can then obtain 1/;(.) and <p(') by integrations from (12.8).
In order to obtain qualitative information about the behavior of the solutions
8(·), we can apply the method of Section 5 to our one-dimensional mechanical
system. Note that if C 1 ~ C 2 (as would be the case if the body were "spinning
fast"), the kinetic energy tends to infinity as 8 --t 0 and as 8 --t Tr. We therefore conclude that 8 oscillates between two values 0 < 81 ::::; 8 ::::; 82 < Tr.
In other words, the axis of symmetry of the body executes a periodic up and down
motion (called nutation). As 8 oscillates, I/; satisfies (12.8). Let us graph the
curve that b a traces out on the unit sphere. If C 1 > C2 cos 8 > 0 for 81 ::::;
8 ::::; 82, then I/; > 0 although it oscillates in magnitude. The motion is thus as
given in Fig. 13.6. Another possibility is that
and
so that I/; is negative near 8 = 81 and positive max 8 = 82, In this case the
average of I/; ovp.r a period is still positive, so that the motion is as shown in
Fig. 13.7.

A limiting case is where C 1 - C2 cos 81 = 0, where the motion of ba is as
shown in Fig. 13.8. (This is the case that arises if the axis of a spinning top is
held fixed at some position 8, '" and then allowed to fall.)
The motion of the axis of body around the z-axis in all these cases is called
precession. It should be remembered that all this time the top is spinning about
its axis with constant angular momentum C2.

Suppose we are given a mechanical system on a manifold l\{ with energy
H = K + U. Suppose that the "force field" dU vanishes at some Xo E l\{.

K(q, q)

= !l: Yij(q)qiqj,

by the one corresponding to the Euclidean metric at xo,
K 2 (q, q)

= !l: Yij(O,

... , O)qiqi.

We thus obtain a mechanical system H 2 whose corresponding equations
(5.1) are actually linear. [The reader should check, as an exercise, that these
equations are exactly the equations of variation (introduced in Section 2) of the
vector field X-dH along the curve C(t) = -<0, ... , ... 0> in T*(M).]
Of course, as time increases, the values of qi and pi might become quit~
large and the linear approximations useless. However, under certain circumstances we can guarantee that qi and pi remain small for all time. In fact,
suppose that the quadratic form l: aijxix i is positive definite. Then U has a
strict minimum at xo-say U(xo) = o. In particular, if we start at Xo with a
kinetic energy K = E, where E is sufficiently small, then x will be restricted to
the neighborhood of Xo defined by U(x) :::;; E, and the momenta will be restricted
by the condition K :::;; E, since, by the conservation of energy, K
U == E.
(See Fig. 13.9.) Thus the qi and the pi will remain small. This does not mean
that the solutions to the original mechanical system with Hamiltonian H will
remain close to one fixed solution curve of the linearized system. It does mean

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

----~------4-------~----E

Fig. 13.9

that for any short interval of time (that is, a short interval near any time in the
future), the trajectory will be close to some trajectory of the linearized system.
It is therefore important to study the behavior of such mechanical systems.
Weare thus interested in the following kind of mechanical system: The configuration space M is a vector space. The Riemann metric is given by a Euclidean
metric on the manifold. The potential energy is a positive definite quadratic
form on this vector space. Let us choose rectangular coordinates x 1, ... , xn
with respect to the Euclidean metric. Thus

and Lagrange's equations become
(13.1)
(Of course, these are just the Euler equations (11.15) for the case at hand where

a == 0.)
Equations (13.1) can be written more suggestively as follows: Let A be the
linear transformation whose matrix is (aii). Stated invariantly, A is the unique
self-adjoint linear transformation such that

Then the trajectories v(·) of the system are the solutions of the second-order

(13.3)

To find the actual solutions of (13.1) and (13.3) we apply Theorem 3.1 of
Chapter 5. According to that theorem, if M is finite-dimensional, we can find an
orthonormal basis e1, ... , en of eigenvalues of A. In other words, if Zi are the

Thus the general motion is a superposition of independent oscillations, the
frequency of each oscillation being determined by the eigenvalues {Ai}. That
is why the mechanical system (13.1) is called a system of "small oscillations".
14. SMALL OSCILLATIONS (Continued)

So far, we have been considering the linearized equations (13.1) as an approximation to a finite-dimensional mechanical system. The philosophy has been
that the solutions to the actual mechanical system exist, but are hard to find.
We use (13.3) as good approximating equations.

(0,1)

Fig. 13.10

It turns out that the method has more extensive applications, even to the
case of infinite-dimensional systems where the very existence of solutions to the
"actual" mechanical systems may be difficult to establish. Let us illustrate by
the mechanical system consisting of a stretched string which is held fixed at two
endpoints. For simplicity in illustration, we shall assume that the string is
restricted to move in the xy-plane, although this is in no way essential to the
argument. Let us assume that the string is homogeneous and that the two
fixed points are (0,0) and (0, 1). Then the configuration space should be all
possible smooth curves joining (0,0) to (0, 1). Thus the curve shown in Fig.
13.10 would be a possible element of our configuration space. In some sense,

554

13.14

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

the configuration is an "infinite-dimensional manifold" and with suitable work
this idea can be made precise. However, what is of interest to us is behavior
near the "equilibrium" curve C(t) = (t,O). For such curves we will have
dx/dt > 0, and so the curve can be described by using x as independent variable,
i.e., by giving a function u(x}. In other words, we are replacing the big configuration space by the approximating vector space V of all functions u of one
variable, with u(O) = u(l) = o. Thus V is regarded as the "tangent space"
to our system, in the sense that u is the "tangent vector" to the curve CB (-),
where CB(T) = CT, SUeT)). (Remember that our configuration space is a
collection of curves, so that a curve in our configuration space is a one-parameter
family of curves.) Now we expect the "kinetic energy" of u to be the total of
the kinetic energy of all the particles on the string. The particle at T has velocity
U(T) and therefore kinetic energy imU(T)2. If we assume that the mass density
is constant, we thus get

as the expression for the kinetic energy. This makes V into a pre-Hilbert space
as in Section 6 of Chapter 6.
We expect that the potential energy depends on the stretching of the string,
i.e., that it is some function of the length:
D(C)

F

(10

Equation (13.3) thus becomes
(14.1)
Note that we have derived (14.1) by reasoning by analogy. We have not
formulated the actual (nonlinear) infinite-dimensional mechanical system, nor
have we any guarantee that there is one that can be solved. Furthermore, we
don't actually know the function F. We only need to know its form and the
value of F'(l). Nevertheless, Eq. (14.1) gives a good explanation of observed
physical phenomena.
The solution of (14.1) proceeds just as in the finite-dimensional case due to
the fact that the operator A with the boundary conditions u(O) = u(l) = 0
is a Sturm-Liouville system, so the results of Sections 6 and 7 of Chapter 6
apply. In fact, we can choose the functions
un(x)

sin (mrx)

as an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors of A, where
n2(c/m)7r 2. Thus the general solution is given by

These can be regarded as "standing waves", as, for example, in Fig. 13.11.

As another illustration of this method, let us consider the "vibrating membrane" in n-dimensions. Here we are given a domain D with almost regular
boundary in lEn. We consider a stretched membrane in IE n+ l = lEn X lEI
which is fastened along aD in P X {O}. Again, as our linear approximation V
to the configuration manifold, we take the space of all functions u on D which
vanish on aD. To be precise, we let V be the space of functions which we
defined, are of class C 2 in some neighborhood TI, and vanish on aD. Thus the
membrane is the surface in IE n + 1 whose points are of the form
<x\ ... , x n , u(x l ,

where <Xl, ... ,x n > ED. As before, we define the kinetic energy as
K(u)

while the potential energy is to be some function of the total volume (area)
which vanishes at p.(D). Now the total volume (area) of the hypersurface is
given by (see Exercise 4.3, Chapter 10)

L~1 + 2: (::iY·

Thus, as before,

U2 (u)

Note that this is exactly (14.1) if n = 1. In order to solve (14.2), we must find
a complete set of eigenvalues for (14.2). If {un} is such a basis, where "Ai is the
eigenvalue associated to Ui, then the general solution of (14.2) would be given by

EXERCISES

In order to study the eigenvalue problem it is convenient to replace the space of
CI-functions vanishing on aD by the space Hf (where we refer back to page 361 for the
definition of the spaces Hf.) To show that this replacement is legitimate, we have:
14.1 Show that if ep is a function which is Cl in a neighborhood of 15, then ep E HD
if and only if ep vanishes on aD.
14.2 Let the operator K be defined as Kf = (1 - Il)f for smooth f and extended as
in Section 14 of Chapter 8 to a map of H. ~ H._ 2 • Let g E Ho. Since

I(g, v) I :::; Ilgllollvllo :::; IIgliollvlll

for any

v E Hf,

conclude that there is a bounded linear map L from H{/ to Hf satisfying
(Lg,

vh

= (g, v)o

for all v E Hf.

14.3 Letf and g be locally integrable functions on D. By this we mean thatfep and
gep are integrable for every test function ep E Co(D). We say that the differential
equation Kf = g holds weakly on D if (f, Kep) = (g, ep) for all test functions ep E Co(D).
Show that this generalizes the notion of being a solution by proving the following
lemma.

Lem.m.a. If the functions f and g are respectively in the classes C2(D) and CO(D),
then the equation Kf = g holds in the weak sense if and only if it holds in the
classical sense.
In proving this lemma you may assume that if h is a continuous function on D
such that JD hep = 0 for every test function ep, then h = O.
14.4 Prove that the operator L of Exercise 14.2 is a right inverse of K in the weak
sense. That is, show that if g E H{/ andf = Lg, then Kf = -g weakly on D.
14.5 We now want to show that f is actually in C2(D) if g is suitably smooth.
Roughly speaking, what we want to do is to "round off" f and g near the boundary of C
in such a way that we can consider the adjusted functions to be defined on the whole
of ~n, and can then apply Exercises 14.25 and 14.30 of Chapter 8.
Our rounding off process will simply be multiplication by an arbitrary but fixed
function 1/1 in Co(D). Prove, to begin with, that multiplication by such a 1/1 is a bounded
linear mapping of H. into itself for any 8.
14.6 We know that D; = ajax; is a bounded linear mapping from H. to H.-l for
every 8. Combine this fact with the result of the above exercise to show that if Kf = g

15. CANONICAL TRANSFORMATIONS

In Sections 1 through 5 we formulated the notion of a mechanical system as a
flow of a certain type on the cotangent bundle of the configuration space. The
defining equations for the vector field X generating this flow were X ...J n =
-dH. Thus the basic property of the cotangent bundle used in singling out the
class of flows is the existence of the two-form n. It turns out that in studying
the equations of mechanics it is sometimes convenient to forget that the flow is
on the cotangent bundle and to concentrate on the form n. For instance, we may
be able to introduce charts that don't arise from the configuration manifold but
in terms of which the vector field X takes a particulary simple form. We shall
therefore want to consider a manifold N which carries a two-form n, subject to
certain restrictions which we shall describe below. On such manifolds we shall
study vector fields satisfying X j n = -dH. It will be convenient to allow H
to depend on the time t, as well as being a function on N, so that X will be a
time-dependent vector field. The reason for this is twofold. First of all, it allows

13.15

CANONICAL TRANSFORMATIONS

the consideration of "nonconservative" mechanical systems. Secondly, even in
the study of the systems we have introduced so far, it is sometimes convenient
to make a time-dependent change of coordinates to simplify the equations. This
has the effect of changin~ 81 time-independent vector field into a time-dependent
one. Now to the definitions:'
Definition. if.: xnanifold N is said to possess a Hamiltonian structure (or to

be a Hamiltonian manifolif) if there is an exterior two-form
such that
i) dn = 8\ and
ii) n is of maximal rank in the sense that (4~3) holds.

n defined on N

Remarks

a) As we have seen, if N = T*(M), then N is a Hamiltonian manifold
where n is given by (4.1).
b) If N is finite-dimensional, then it must be even-dimensionall In fact,
condition (ii) says that n restricted to each tangent space:is an antisymmetric
bilinear form which is nonsingular. This can happen on a; vector only if it is
even-dimensional.
c) It can be proved that if N is a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian manifold,
then one can always find local coordinates ql, ... , qn, PI, ... ,Pn such that
~\ =

L

dPi /\ dqi.

[We know this to be the case if N = T*(M).] The point of this result (which
we shall not prove here) is that locally all Hamiltonian manifolds of the same
finite dimension look alike.
We shall now single out a class of vector fields on N X IR.
Definition. The vector field X is a Hamiltonian vector field if there is a
= Hx on N X IR such that

function H

Xt = (X, dt) == 1,

(15.1)

where t is the standard coordinate on IR, regarded as a function on N X IR,
and

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

If we consider the direct sum decomposition of the tangent space of N X JR,
then condition (15.1) says that we can write

X=

(x,~),

where X is a time-dependent vector field on N; that is, X is a rule which assigns
a tangent vector X(x, t) E Tz(N) to each x and t. Since w does not involve dt,
we can write
at any time t.
X .J w = X(·, t) .J n
(15.3)
[Strictly speaking, this equality should be written as follows: Let it: N
be the map defined by it(x) = (x, t). Then
ii(X.J w)

=

X(·, t) .J n.]

(15.3')

Also,

-

at any time t.

Thus (15.2) can be split up into two equations. When we compare the terms not
involving dt, we obtain

-dH(·, t)

for every fixed t.

(15.2a)

Thus

-

X .J w = -dH

(15.2b)

Note that (15.2a) is just the condition stated at the beginning of Section 5 with
the novelty that H (and therefore X) can now depend on time.
Definition. A diffeomorphism, cp, of N X JR ~ N X JR is called a canonical
transformation if
i) cp*(w) = w - dW 1\ dt, where W = Wi' is some function depending
on cp; and

13.15

CANONICAL TRANSFORMATIONS

Fig. 13.13

ii) iP is time-preserving, i.e., iP has the form iP(x, t) = (!p(x, t), t), where
!p(', t) is a diffeomorphism of N for each t.
Observe that if iP is a canonical transformation, then so is iP- 1 and
Wq;-l = -(iP')*Wq;'

(15.4)

Also observe that if iP and if; are canonical transformations, then so is if; 0 iP,
where
(15.5)
These facts follow directly from the definitions and will be left as exercises for the
reader.
We note next that if iP is a canonical transformation and X is a Hamiltonian
vector field, then iP*(X) is also a Hamiltonian vector field. In fact,
iP*X..J [w - d(Wq;

+ iP*H)

/\ dt] = iP*X..J [iP*w - iP*(dH /\ dt)]
= iP*[X..J (w - dH /\ dt)] = O.

Thus we may take H 'P*X as
H;p*x = Wq;

+ iP*H.

(15.6)

Let X be a Haxniltonian vector field, and let iP be the map of N X IR ~ N X IR
obtained by letting the system evolve from time t = 0 according to the flow
generated by X. That is, let the map !p(', t) be defined so that the curve
t 1-+ !p(x, t) is a solution curve to the (time-dependent) vector field X which
passes through x at time t = O. To put it another way, the curve t 1-+ (!p(x, t), t)
is the solution curve to the vector field X which passes through (x, 0) at time
zero. (See Figs. 13.12 and 13.13.)
Note that it follows from the definition of iP that
iP*

(~) =

X'P(Z,t).

We claim that iP is a canonical transformation. In fact,
ii(iP*w)

-ip*Hx.

Note that (15.7) is just what we would expect from (15.6). In fact, rp*X = a/at,
and we may take H a/at = O.
Equations (15.6) and (15.7) are used in conjunction in the following way:
Suppose that H = H 0 H b where we know how to solve the differential
equations corresponding to H o. In other words, we can find the map ip corresponding to the vector field X 0, where X 0 ...J (w - dH 0 1\ dt) = O. If

+

X .J (w - dH 1\ dt)

=

0,

then rp*X is a vector field whose corresponding Hamiltonian function is ip*H 1
by (15.6)
This method was first introduced by Lagrange in the study of the n-body
problem. We can let H 0 be the Hamiltonian obtained by ignoring the terms in
the potential energy coming from the interaction of the planets, and let HI be
the rest of the Hamiltonian H. The solution for H 0 is then given by having the
planets move about the sun according to Kepler's laws. For simplicity in
discussion, let us restrict our attention to that portion of phase space where the
motion is elliptical. Then the motion of the planets is specified by giving the
various parameters of each ellipse (such as the plane of the ellipse, its major
axis, its eccentricity, etc.) and telling the position of the planet on its ellipse at
time t = O. This corresponds to the use of the map rp. One then regards the
equations of motion of the whole system as differential equations for the
parameters of each ellipse. This corresponds to studying the vector field rp* X.
This idea of introducing the parameters of the ellipses as "generalized" coordinates was one of the key steps leading to the notion of the invariant calculus
on manifolds.
We have seen that solving the differential equations corresponding to a
Hamiltonian H is the same as looking for a map ip satisfying (l5.7). Under
certain circumstances this can be reduced to looking for the solution to a certain
partial differential equation. Suppose that we have local coordinates ql • ••. , q..,

Equation (15.9) is known as the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
We therefore have a prescription for (locally) solving the equations of
motion: Find a solution V of (15.9) which has the property that <PI and <P2 are
diffeomorphisms. Under certain circumstances, a proper choice of coordinates
allows us to solve (15.9) by the method of "separation of variables". We illustrate this method in the following examples.
